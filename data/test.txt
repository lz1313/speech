RG-20130311-oty-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
RG-20130311-oty-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
RG-20130311-oty-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
RG-20130311-oty-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
RG-20130311-oty-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
RG-20130311-oty-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
RG-20130311-oty-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
RG-20130311-oty-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
RG-20130311-oty-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
RG-20130311-oty-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
Robert-20130511-znp-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
Robert-20130511-znp-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
Robert-20130511-znp-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
Robert-20130511-znp-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
Robert-20130511-znp-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
Robert-20130511-znp-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
Robert-20130511-znp-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
Robert-20130511-znp-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
Robert-20130511-znp-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
Robert-20130511-znp-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0017-20080227-twp-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0127-20081211-mil-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous0203-20090618-emm-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous0236-20090902-pfo-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous0289-20091220-xjy-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0307-20100109-yqt-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0406-20100610-dxf-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
anonymous0452-20100820-dum-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous0515-20101204-aef-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0622-20111004-fxb-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
anonymous0696-20120207-lin-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0843-20130218-klv-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0971-20150512-lmf-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
bennmann-20091102-apc-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
bennmann-20091102-ksm-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
bennmann-20091102-vgn-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
geistgesicht-20071018-naz-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
jcwill-20131104-pah-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
jcwill-20131104-pah-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
jcwill-20131104-pah-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
jcwill-20131104-pah-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
jcwill-20131104-pah-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
jcwill-20131104-pah-a0006 GOD BLESS EM I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
jcwill-20131104-pah-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
jcwill-20131104-pah-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
jcwill-20131104-pah-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
jcwill-20131104-pah-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
jcwill-20131104-shn-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
jcwill-20131104-shn-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
jcwill-20131104-shn-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
jcwill-20131104-shn-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
jcwill-20131104-shn-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
jcwill-20131104-shn-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
jcwill-20131104-shn-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
jcwill-20131104-shn-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
jcwill-20131104-shn-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
jcwill-20131104-shn-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
patchesthecaveman-20101112-ooz-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
patchesthecaveman-20101112-rux-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
patchesthecaveman-20101112-rux-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
patchesthecaveman-20101112-rux-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
patchesthecaveman-20101112-rux-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
patchesthecaveman-20101112-rux-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
patchesthecaveman-20101112-rux-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
patchesthecaveman-20101112-rux-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
