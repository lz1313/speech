1028-20100710-hne-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
1028-20100710-hne-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
1028-20100710-hne-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
1028-20100710-hne-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
1028-20100710-hne-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
1028-20100710-hne-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
1028-20100710-hne-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
1028-20100710-hne-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
1028-20100710-hne-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
1028-20100710-hne-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
1snoke-20120412-hge-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
2old2play-20110606-hcn-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
2old2play-20110606-wlt-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
314piwm-20130617-xuo-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
Aaron-20130527-giy-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
AdrianMcNear-20091016-psv-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Afshad-20090813-zcz-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
AlexW-20110510-hzr-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATION
AlexW-20110510-hzr-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
AlexW-20110510-hzr-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
AlexW-20110510-hzr-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
AlexW-20110510-hzr-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
AlexW-20110510-hzr-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
AlexW-20110510-hzr-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
AlexW-20110510-hzr-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
AlexW-20110510-hzr-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
AlexW-20110510-hzr-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
Anniepoo-20140308-bft-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
Anniepoo-20140308-byi-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
Anniepoo-20140308-cqj-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
Anniepoo-20140308-fcp-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
Anniepoo-20140308-hns-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
Anniepoo-20140308-xot-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
Anniepoo-20140308-zwy-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
Apple_Eater-20091026-yul-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
Ara-20091020-vni-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
Ara-20091020-vni-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
Ara-20091020-vni-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
Ara-20091020-vni-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
Ara-20091020-vni-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
Ara-20091020-vni-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
Ara-20091020-vni-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
Ara-20091020-vni-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
Ara-20091020-vni-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
Ara-20091020-vni-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
Ara-20091021-wpl-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
Ara-20091021-wpl-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
B-20091220-vus-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
B-20091220-vus-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
B-20091220-vus-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
B-20091220-vus-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
B-20091220-vus-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
B-20091220-vus-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
B-20091220-vus-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
B-20091220-vus-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
B-20091220-vus-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
B-20091220-vus-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
B-20091220-zaq-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
B-20091220-zaq-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
B-20091220-zaq-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
B-20091220-zaq-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
B-20091220-zaq-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
B-20091220-zaq-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
B-20091220-zaq-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
B-20091220-zaq-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
B-20091220-zaq-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
B-20091220-zaq-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
B-20091221-pxt-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
B-20091221-pxt-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
B-20091221-pxt-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
B-20091221-pxt-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
B-20091221-pxt-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
B-20091221-pxt-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
B-20091221-pxt-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
B-20091221-pxt-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
B-20091221-pxt-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
B-20091221-pxt-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
B-20091223-lxu-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
B-20091223-lxu-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
B-20091223-lxu-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
B-20091223-lxu-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
B-20091223-lxu-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
B-20091223-lxu-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
B-20091223-lxu-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
B-20091223-lxu-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
B-20091223-lxu-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
B-20091223-lxu-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
B-20091230-bvx-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
B-20091230-bvx-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
B-20091230-bvx-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
B-20091230-bvx-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
B-20091230-bvx-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
B-20091230-bvx-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
B-20091230-bvx-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
B-20091230-bvx-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
B-20091230-bvx-a0584 HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
B-20091230-bvx-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
B-20091230-umt-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
B-20091230-umt-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
B-20091230-umt-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
B-20091230-umt-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
B-20091230-umt-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
B-20091230-umt-b0283 WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
B-20091230-umt-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
B-20091230-umt-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
B-20091230-umt-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
B-20091230-umt-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
B-20091230-yjo-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
B-20091230-yjo-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
B-20091230-yjo-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
B-20091230-yjo-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
B-20091230-yjo-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
B-20091230-yjo-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
B-20091230-yjo-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
B-20091230-yjo-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
B-20091230-yjo-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
B-20091230-yjo-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
BFG-20120316-bdl-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
Bahoke-20130721-brs-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
Bahoke-20130721-hgw-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
Bahoke-20130721-iux-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
Bahoke-20130721-jpg-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH QUICKLY BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
Bahoke-20130721-mba-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
Bahoke-20130721-qpx-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
Bahoke-20130721-sjx-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
Bahoke-20130721-unp-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO CHEMICAL PRE DISTRIBUTION TOWARD ALCOHOL
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
Bahoke-20130721-uop-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
Bahoke-20130721-wit-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
Bahoke-20130721-zau-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED

Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
Bareford-20101110-qkl-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
Berrym-20101102-aiv-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
BillMorgan-20120306-aef-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
Blenderkitty-20090615-qcv-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
Blenderkitty-20090615-rjb-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
Blenderkitty-20090615-svy-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
Blenderkitty-20090615-tsi-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
Blenderkitty-20090615-ytz-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
BlindPilot-20100610-ama-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
BlindPilot-20100610-bzv-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
BlindPilot-20100610-hnf-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
BlindPilot-20100610-kko-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
BlindPilot-20100610-ulk-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
BlueB-20090727-ckj-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
BlueB-20090727-poc-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
Bob-20100106-mwu-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
BobHallstrom-20150105-tmy-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
BobHallstrom-20150105-uii-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME

BobHallstrom-20150105-zdp-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
BobHallstrom-20150105-zdp-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
BobHallstrom-20150105-zdp-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
BobHallstrom-20150105-zdp-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
BobHallstrom-20150105-zdp-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
BobHallstrom-20150105-zdp-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
BobHallstrom-20150105-zdp-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
BossOfTheGame-20090129-hzr-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
BradenJH-20110519-hvn-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
BruceCouper-20080305-yre-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
CaptainSpok-20090509-rbo-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
CarlFK-20080617-jii-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
CarlFK-20080617-tus-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
CbS-20120222-tqn-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
CbS2-20120222-vbu-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
Chas-20100107-yfs-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
CheesyBreed-20080413-rna-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
CheesyBreed-20080413-srs-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
CheesyBreed-20080413-vhf-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
CheesyBreed-20080413-zms-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
CheesyBreed-20080413-zwe-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
Coren-20141121-bhk-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
Coren-20141121-bpi-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
Coren-20141121-fnm-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
Coren-20141121-kly-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
Coren-20141121-kly-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
Coren-20141121-kly-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
Coren-20141121-kly-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
Coren-20141121-kly-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
Coren-20141121-kly-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
Coren-20141121-kly-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
Coren-20141121-kly-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
Coren-20141121-kly-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
Coren-20141121-kly-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0484 NO SIR EE
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
Coren-20141121-kxj-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
Coren-20141121-mku-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
Coren-20141121-mku-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
Coren-20141121-mku-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
Coren-20141121-mku-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
Coren-20141121-mku-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
Coren-20141121-mku-a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
Coren-20141121-mku-a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
Coren-20141121-mku-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
Coren-20141121-mku-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
Coren-20141121-mku-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
Coren-20141121-oaz-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
Coren-20141121-ocx-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
Coren-20141121-pxp-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
Coren-20141121-qxa-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Coren-20141121-rlh-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
Coren-20141121-sjb-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
Coren-20141121-ugy-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
Coren-20141121-vvd-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
Coren-20141121-wdk-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
Coren-20141121-yfc-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
CptOatmeal-20080721-vnh-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
CraigWilliamson-20110616-qvp-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
CraigWilliamson-20110616-xht-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
DammitCoetzeecom-20101020-qml-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
DanR-20090223-eta-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
DanR-20090223-eta-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
DanR-20090223-eta-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
DanR-20090223-eta-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
DanR-20090223-eta-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
DanR-20090223-eta-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
DanR-20090223-eta-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
DanR-20090223-eta-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
DanR-20090223-eta-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
DanR-20090223-eta-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
DanR-20090223-fys-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
DanR-20090223-fys-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
DanR-20090223-fys-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
DanR-20090223-fys-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
DanR-20090223-fys-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
DanR-20090223-fys-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
DanR-20090223-fys-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
DanR-20090223-fys-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
DanR-20090223-fys-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
DanR-20090223-fys-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
DanR-20090223-qnv-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
DanR-20090223-uln-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
DanR-20090223-uln-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
DanR-20090223-uln-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
DanR-20090223-uln-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
DanR-20090223-uln-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
DanR-20090223-uln-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
DanR-20090223-uln-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
DanR-20090223-uln-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
DanR-20090223-uln-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
DanR-20090223-uln-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
DavidBender-20120617-igv-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
DavidBender-20120617-igv-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
DavidBender-20120617-igv-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
DavidBender-20120617-igv-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
DavidBender-20120617-igv-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
DavidBender-20120617-igv-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
DavidBender-20120617-igv-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
DavidBender-20120617-igv-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
DavidBender-20120617-igv-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
DavidBender-20120617-igv-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
Dcoetzee-20110429-bne-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
Dcoetzee-20110429-bqy-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
Dcoetzee-20110429-cmf-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxg-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
Dcoetzee-20110429-cxm-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
Dcoetzee-20110429-dac-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
Dcoetzee-20110429-fmi-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
Dcoetzee-20110429-ghe-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
Dcoetzee-20110429-gre-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
Dcoetzee-20110429-hsi-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvv-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
Dcoetzee-20110429-jdw-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
Dcoetzee-20110429-mli-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Dcoetzee-20110429-mzz-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
Dcoetzee-20110429-ono-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
Dcoetzee-20110429-plk-a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
Dcoetzee-20110429-qvd-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
Dcoetzee-20110429-rmx-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
Dcoetzee-20110429-top-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
Dcoetzee-20110429-vad-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
Dcoetzee-20110429-vmo-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
Dcoetzee-20110429-ygs-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
DeepBlue-20121003-jmk-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
DeepBlue-20130305-ydd-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
Diego-20131023-zpg-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP

Dra-20150325-xcm-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
Dra-20150325-xcm-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
Dra-20150325-xcm-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM

Dra-20150325-xcm-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
Dra-20150325-xcm-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
Dra-20150325-xcm-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW

ETT-20090329-typ-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
ETT-20090329-typ-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
ETT-20090329-typ-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
ETT-20090329-typ-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST

Edman274-20090103-fja-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Edman274-20090103-fja-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
Edman274-20090103-fmy-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
Edman274-20090103-vga-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
Edman274-20090511-cxp-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED

Edman274-20091113-qfw-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
Edman274-20091113-qfw-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
Edman274-20091113-qfw-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
Edman274-20091113-qfw-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
Edman274-20091113-qfw-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
Edman274-20091113-qfw-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
Edman274-20091113-qfw-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
Edman274-20091113-qfw-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
EricV-20120527-jyq-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
EricV-20120527-sdq-a0484 NO SIR EE
EricV-20120527-stf-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
EricV-20120527-stf-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
EricV-20120527-stf-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
EricV-20120527-stf-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
EricV-20120527-stf-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
EricV-20120527-stf-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
EricV-20120527-stf-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
EricV-20120527-stf-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
EricV-20120527-stf-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
EricV-20120527-stf-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
Ertain-20100728-eum-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
Ertain-20100728-euy-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
Ertain-20100728-jxz-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
Ertain-20100728-twq-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
Ertain-20101126-abx-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
Ertain-20101126-xnl-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
Ertain-20110602-lec-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
Ertain-20110602-zpj-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
Ertain-20110621-jcl-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
Ertain-20110719-osz-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
Ertain-20140805-eeb-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
Ertain-20140805-nqz-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
Ertain-20140805-rus-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
Ertain-20140805-tez-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
Ertain-20140805-yaw-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
Ertain-20140808-kai-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
Ertain-20140808-lmk-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
Ertain-20140808-lyt-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
Ertain-20140808-qeo-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
Ertain-20140905-bnc-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
Ertain-20140905-ptf-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
Ertain-20140905-ptf-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
Ertain-20140905-ptf-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
Ertain-20140905-ptf-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
Ertain-20140905-ptf-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
Ertain-20140905-ptf-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
Ertain-20140905-ptf-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO

Everett-20130514-hkp-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
Felipe-20120510-rlo-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
Felipe-20120510-rlo-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
Felipe-20120510-rlo-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
Felipe-20120510-rlo-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
Felipe-20120510-rlo-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
Felipe-20120510-rlo-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
Felipe-20120510-rlo-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS

Firefox005-20100820-qku-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
Firefox005-20100820-wyt-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET

Flllapy-20140115-ttp-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
Flllapy-20140115-ttp-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
Flllapy-20140115-ttp-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
Flllapy-20140115-ttp-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
Flllapy-20140115-ttp-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
GS-20130527-fxh-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
GS-20130527-fxh-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
GS-20130527-fxh-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
GS-20130527-fxh-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
GS-20130527-fxh-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
GS-20130527-fxh-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
GS-20130527-fxh-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE

GS-20130527-fxh-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU

GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
GaylandGGump-20141207-awo-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
GaylandGGump-20141207-bbg-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0484 NO SIR EE
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
GaylandGGump-20141207-dyd-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
GaylandGGump-20141207-jhc-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
GaylandGGump-20141207-jvx-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
GaylandGGump-20141207-kew-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
GaylandGGump-20141207-ksv-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
GaylandGGump-20141207-lqm-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
GaylandGGump-20141207-msr-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
GaylandGGump-20141207-oxm-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
GaylandGGump-20141207-pdo-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
GaylandGGump-20141207-trp-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
GaylandGGump-20141207-uva-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
GaylandGGump-20141207-why-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
GaylandGGump-20141207-zey-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
GaylandGGump-20141207-zlh-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0329 AH INDEED
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
Georgio-20100123-efd-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
Gerard-20140525-res-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
Gerard-20140525-res-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
Gerard-20140525-res-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Gerard-20140525-res-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Gerard-20140525-res-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Gerard-20140525-res-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Gerard-20140525-res-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Gerard-20140525-res-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
Gerard-20140525-res-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
Gerard-20140525-res-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
Grill-20120728-sel-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Grill-20120728-sel-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Grill-20120728-sel-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Grill-20120728-sel-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Grill-20120728-sel-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
Grill-20120728-sel-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
Grill-20120728-sel-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
Grill-20120728-sel-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
Grill-20120728-sel-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
Grill-20120728-sel-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
Gulain-20140302-jof-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION

Gulain-20140302-jof-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
Gulain-20140302-jof-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
Gulain-20140302-jof-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
Gulain-20140302-jof-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
Gulain-20140302-jof-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
GusSCalabrese-20100331-eik-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
GusSCalabrese-20100331-eik-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE

GusSCalabrese-20100331-eik-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
GusSCalabrese-20100331-eik-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
GusSCalabrese-20100331-eik-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
GusSCalabrese-20100331-eik-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY

GusSCalabrese-20100331-eik-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
GusSCalabrese-20100331-jxn-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
GusSCalabrese-20100331-jxn-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
GusSCalabrese-20100331-jxn-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
GusSCalabrese-20100331-jxn-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM

J0hnny_b14z3-20111219-ibu-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
J0hnny_b14z3-20111219-rjo-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT

JRB-20080602-qyg-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
JRB-20080602-qyg-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
JRB-20080602-qyg-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
JRB-20080602-qyg-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
JRB-20080602-qyg-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
JRB-20080602-qyg-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
JRB-20080602-qyg-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
JRB-20080602-qyg-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
JRB-20080602-qyg-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
JVUnderground-20100821-qxi-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
JamesHays-20090703-gok-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
JanusDaniels-20100720-pkl-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
Jay1853-20140409-dxy-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-btn-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-bvy-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-dmf-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-htt-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ick-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-mbz-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-nlx-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ovg-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-psp-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-pus-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-rih-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA

JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-ryd-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-siv-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE

JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-szm-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-uau-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vdn-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vev-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE

JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-vre-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT

JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM

JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-wqq-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
JazziiBuu-20130129-opn-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID

Jeff-20100224-igb-b0037 KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
Jeff-20100224-igb-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
JimWhite-20100807-dua-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
JimWhite-20100807-dua-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
JimWhite-20100807-dua-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
JimWhite-20100807-dua-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL

JimWhite-20100807-dua-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
JimWhite-20100807-dua-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
JimWhite-20100807-gsx-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR

JimWhite-20100807-lhk-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
JimWhite-20100807-lhk-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
JimWhite-20100807-lhk-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
JimWhite-20100807-lhk-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
JimWhite-20100807-lhk-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
JimWhite-20100807-zqj-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
JivanAmara-20080724-jeh-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
JivanAmara-20080724-lvv-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
Joel-20080716-qoz-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Joel-20080716-qoz-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
Joel-20080716-qoz-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
Joel-20080716-qoz-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
Joel-20080716-qoz-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
Joel-20080716-qoz-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING

Joel-20080716-qoz-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
Joel-20080716-qoz-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
Joel-20080716-qoz-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
JohnGalt-20111007-xxy-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
JohnGalt-20111007-xxy-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID

KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
KalikiCEO-20130402-cfx-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
KenBloom-20071112-ryd-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
KenBloom-20071122-ceg-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
KenBloom-20071122-fot-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0484 NO SIR EE
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
KenBloom-20071122-xfp-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
Keren-20080605-cps-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
Keren-20080605-cps-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
Keren-20080605-cps-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
Keren-20080605-cps-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
Keren-20080605-cps-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
Keren-20080605-cps-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
Keren-20080605-cps-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
Keren-20080605-cps-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
Keren-20080605-cps-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
Keren-20080605-cps-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
KnitGirl-20071113-dil-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
Kodiak-20100820-sll-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
Krellis-20090608-fyo-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
Krellis-20090608-jue-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN

Krellis-20090608-sjw-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
Krellis-20090608-sjw-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
Krellis-20090608-sjw-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
Krellis-20090608-sjw-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS

Krellis-20090608-wuu-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
Krellis-20090608-wuu-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
Krellis-20090608-wuu-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
Krellis-20090608-wuu-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL

Krellis-20090609-wfz-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
Krellis-20090609-wfz-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
Krellis-20090609-wfz-a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK

Krellis-20090609-wfz-a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
Krellis-20090609-wfz-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
Kupiakos-20121022-wjd-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
LAVEENAZ-20100515-soe-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
LAVEENAZ-20100515-zaq-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fjt-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
LAVEENAZ-20100516-fmt-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
LAVEENAZ-20100516-gpj-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
LAVEENAZ-20100516-kgh-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
LAVEENAZ-20100516-yxi-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
Lafsq-20130703-dcl-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
Lexen-20071106-mrd-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
Logomancer-20100820-hhi-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
Logomancer-20100820-inh-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
Logomancer-20100820-qcu-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Logomancer-20100820-qcu-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
Logomancer-20100820-qcu-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED

Logomancer-20100820-qcu-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
Logomancer-20100820-qcu-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
Lomoco-20081006-xbi-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
Lomoco-20081006-xbi-b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
Lomoco-20081006-xbi-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
Lomoco-20081006-xbi-b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
Lomoco-20081006-xbi-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

LuisManuelPradoMoreno-20130104-wna-b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN

MARTIN0AMY-20111106-pwg-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
MARTIN0AMY-20111106-pwg-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM

MARTIN0AMY-20111106-pwg-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
MARTIN0AMY-20111106-pwg-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
MARTIN0AMY-20111106-pwg-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
MARTIN0AMY-20111106-pwg-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
MARTIN0AMY-20111106-pwg-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
MJ-20130703-arq-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
MJ-20130703-arq-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
MJ-20130703-arq-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
MJ-20130703-arq-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
MJ-20130703-arq-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
MJ-20130703-arq-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
MJ-20130703-arq-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
MJ-20130703-arq-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
MJ-20130703-arq-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
MJ-20130703-arq-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
MS-20121113-rgm-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER

MS-20121113-rgm-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
MS-20121113-rgm-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
MS-20121113-rgm-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
MS-20121113-rgm-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
MS-20121113-rgm-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
MS-20121113-rgm-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE

MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
MahaIbrahim-20110924-eco-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
Melissa-20081211-apn-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES

Melissa-20081211-apn-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
Melissa-20081211-apn-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
Melissa-20081211-apn-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
Melissa-20081211-apn-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
Melissa-20081211-apn-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
Melissa-20081211-apn-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
Melissa-20081211-apn-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
Melissa-20081211-apn-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
Melissa-20081211-ehn-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
Melissa-20081211-mov-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
Melissa-20081211-qhg-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE

Michelle-20131029-oxi-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
Michelle-20131029-oxi-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
Michelle-20131029-oxi-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
Michelle-20131029-oxi-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
Michelle-20131029-oxi-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
Michelle-20131029-oxi-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
Michelle-20131029-oxi-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
Michelle-20131029-oxi-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT

Mike-20081006-bym-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
Mike-20081006-bym-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
Mike-20081006-bym-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT

Mike-20081010-gmj-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
Mike-20081010-igv-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
Mike-20081010-igv-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
Mike-20081010-igv-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
Mike-20081010-igv-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
Mike-20081010-igv-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
Mike-20081010-igv-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
Mike-20081010-igv-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
Mike-20081010-igv-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
Mike-20081010-igv-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
Mike-20081010-igv-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
Mindseye-20071101-csn-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
Mindseye-20071101-csn-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
Mindseye-20071101-csn-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
Mindseye-20071101-csn-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
Mindseye-20071101-csn-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
Mindseye-20071101-csn-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
Mindseye-20071101-csn-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME

MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
MrDoNotBreak-20100821-oin-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
Nadim-20100515-efk-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
Nadim-20100515-grp-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
Nadim-20100515-mwu-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
Nadim-20100515-uum-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
Nadim-20100515-wjj-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
Nadim-20100515-zob-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
Nathan-20090324-ova-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
Nerocon-20100319-eed-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG

Rain-20120720-ymm-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
Rain-20120720-ymm-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
Rain-20120720-ymm-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
Rain-20120720-ymm-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
Rain-20120720-ymm-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
Rain-20120720-ymm-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
Rain-20120720-ymm-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
Rain-20120720-ymm-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE

Revelation2221-20080510-ysv-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Revelation2221-20080510-ysv-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE

RobSmith-20091103-mog-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
RobSmith-20091103-mog-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
RobSmith-20091103-mog-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
RobSmith-20091103-mog-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
RobSmith-20091103-tds-b0495 WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
RobSmith-20091103-tds-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
RobSmith-20091103-tds-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
RobSmith-20091103-tds-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
RobSmith-20091103-tds-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
RobSmith-20091103-tds-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE

RobSmith-20091103-tds-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
RobSmith-20091103-tds-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
RobSmith-20091103-urx-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT

RobSmith-20091103-urx-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
RobSmith-20091103-urx-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
RobSmith-20091103-urx-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
RobSmith-20091103-urx-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES

RobSmith-20091103-ypu-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
RobSmith-20091103-ypu-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
RobSmith-20091103-ypu-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
RobSmith-20091103-ypu-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
RobSmith-20091103-ypu-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
RobSmith-20091103-ypu-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS

RobertPoole-20111111-ztg-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
RobertPoole-20111111-ztg-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL

Sepero-20090315-cec-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
Sepero-20090315-cec-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON

Sepero-20090315-wuu-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
Sepero-20090315-wuu-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
Sepero-20090315-wuu-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN

Thomas-20080507-djr-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
Thomas-20080507-djr-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
Thomas-20080507-iya-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
Thomas-20080508-vzo-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
Thuban-20120601-lbj-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
Tim018-20120503-kml-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
Timsage-20080612-ebb-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
Timsage-20080612-rsz-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
Tolstyak-20130902-ggi-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
Tolstyak-20130902-mas-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
Tolstyak-20130902-tmz-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
Tolstyak-20130902-vfj-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES

TomM-20120224-xnp-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
TomM-20120224-xnp-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
TomM-20120224-xnp-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
TomM-20120224-xnp-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
TomM-20120224-xnp-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
TomM-20120224-xnp-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
TomM-20120224-xnp-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
TomM-20120224-xnp-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
TrueJournals-20120611-xiu-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
Velvet-20131027-fdf-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
Velvet-20131027-fwx-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
Velvet-20131027-fwx-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE

Velvet-20131027-fwx-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
Velvet-20131027-fwx-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
Velvet-20131027-fwx-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
Vortex-20130109-imz-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
Vortex-20130109-imz-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
Vortex-20130109-imz-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
Vortex-20130109-imz-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL

Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
Xeddius-20140130-cli-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
Yoyoma31314-20100327-fld-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
Yoyoma31314-20100327-fld-a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
Yoyoma31314-20100327-fld-a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER

Yoyoma31314-20100327-fld-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
Yoyoma31314-20100327-fld-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
Yoyoma31314-20100327-fld-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
Zorthius-20100820-ifs-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
_r2h-20100822-kmh-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
aahz-20100418-xhv-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
ablackball-20121113-lxs-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0329 AH INDEED
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
ablackball-20121113-vvk-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
adgar-20091227-ell-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
adgar-20091227-ell-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
adgar-20091227-ell-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
adgar-20091227-ell-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
adgar-20091227-ell-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
adgar-20091227-ell-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
adgar-20091227-ell-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
adgar-20091227-ell-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
ahbigalex10-20090529-owx-b0288 NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
ahbigalex10-20090529-owx-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
ahbigalex10-20090529-owx-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
ahbigalex10-20090529-owx-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
ahbigalex10-20090529-owx-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
ahbigalex10-20090529-owx-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
ahbigalex10-20090529-owx-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
aileen-20080831-dfq-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
aileen-20080831-ema-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON
aileen-20080831-ema-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
aileen-20080831-ema-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
aileen-20080831-ema-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
aileen-20080831-ema-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
aileen-20080831-ema-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
aileen-20080831-ema-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
aileen-20080831-ema-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
aileen-20080831-ema-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
aileen-20080831-ema-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
aileen-20080831-iqs-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
aileen-20080831-qwt-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
aileen-20080831-sgd-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
aileen-20080831-zdn-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
ajforesto4Christ-20120313-wgj-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
ajt13a-20140328-xyv-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
akp-20150308-bxm-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
akp-20150308-bxm-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
akp-20150308-bxm-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
akp-20150308-bxm-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
akp-20150308-bxm-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
akp-20150308-bxm-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
akp-20150308-bxm-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
akp-20150308-bxm-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
akp-20150308-bxm-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
akp-20150308-bxm-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
akp-20150308-kyy-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
akp-20150308-kyy-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
akp-20150308-kyy-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
akp-20150308-kyy-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
akp-20150308-kyy-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
akp-20150308-kyy-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
akp-20150308-kyy-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
akp-20150308-kyy-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
akp-20150308-kyy-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
akp-20150308-kyy-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
albert-20120314-yli-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
albert-20120314-yli-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
albert-20120314-yli-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
albert-20120314-yli-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
albert-20120314-yli-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
albert-20120314-yli-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
albert-20120314-yli-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
albert-20120314-yli-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
albert-20120314-yli-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID
alec-20090912-aws-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
alec-20090912-aws-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
alec-20090912-aws-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
alec-20090912-aws-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
alec-20090912-aws-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
alec-20090912-aws-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
alec-20090912-aws-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
alec-20090912-aws-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
alec-20090912-aws-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
alec-20090912-aws-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
alec-20090912-hhr-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
alec-20090912-hhr-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
alec-20090912-hhr-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
alec-20090912-hhr-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
alec-20090912-hhr-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
alec-20090912-hhr-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
alec-20090912-hhr-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
alec-20090912-hhr-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
alec-20090912-hhr-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
alec-20090912-hhr-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
alec-20090912-jip-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
alec-20090912-jip-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
alec-20090912-jip-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
alec-20090912-jip-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
alec-20090912-jip-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
alec-20090912-jip-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
alec-20090912-jip-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
alec-20090912-jip-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
alec-20090912-jip-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
alec-20090912-jip-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
alec-20090912-otq-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
alec-20090912-otq-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
alec-20090912-otq-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
alec-20090912-otq-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
alec-20090912-otq-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
alec-20090912-otq-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
alec-20090912-otq-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
alec-20090912-otq-a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
alec-20090912-otq-a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
alec-20090912-otq-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
alliga34tor-20090201-xdo-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
allison-20120707-ogo-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
allison-20120707-ogo-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
allison-20120707-ogo-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
allison-20120707-ogo-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
allison-20120707-ogo-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
allison-20120707-ogo-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
allison-20120707-ogo-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
allison-20120707-ogo-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
allison-20120707-ogo-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
allison-20120707-ogo-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
allison-20120707-xik-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
allison-20120707-xik-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
allison-20120707-xik-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
allison-20120707-xik-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
allison-20120707-xik-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
allison-20120707-xik-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
allison-20120707-xik-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
allison-20120707-xik-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
allison-20120707-xik-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
allison-20120707-xik-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
almotter-20110721-naj-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
almotter-20110721-naj-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
almotter-20110721-naj-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
almotter-20110721-naj-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
almotter-20110721-naj-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
almotter-20110721-naj-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
almotter-20110721-naj-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
almotter-20110721-naj-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
almotter-20110721-naj-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
almotter-20110721-naj-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
almotter-20110721-yaa-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
alphadecay-20090623-dmq-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
alphadecay-20090623-epc-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
alphadecay-20090623-wtn-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM

anap40-20120402-wto-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anap40-20120402-wto-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
anap40-20120402-wto-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anap40-20120402-wto-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
anap40-20120402-wto-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anap40-20120402-wto-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anap40-20120402-wto-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
anap40-20120402-wto-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anap40-20120402-wto-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anap40-20120402-wto-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anastaciaeg-20090122-edg-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anirban-20130910-imi-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anirban-20130910-imi-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anirban-20130910-imi-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anirban-20130910-imi-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anirban-20130910-imi-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anirban-20130910-imi-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anirban-20130910-imi-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anirban-20130910-imi-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anirban-20130910-imi-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anirban-20130910-imi-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
anoldman-20110217-dbg-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0329 AH INDEED
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
anoldman-20110217-fbq-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anoldman-20110219-irb-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0077 IT IS FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0078 THEN AT SUPPER SHE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0082 MY FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0001-20071014-yqs-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0002-20071025-ewv-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous0003-20071025-lvi-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous0004-20071027-xjk-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous0005-20071105-hwr-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous0006-20071125-xna-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS

anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous0007-20071128-qbd-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous0008-20071220-zqp-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous0009-20080117-jkd-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
anonymous0010-20080117-wqy-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous0011-20080119-hjn-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous0012-20080119-pxh-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous0013-20080121-cjq-b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous0014-20080204-hzw-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
anonymous0015-20080224-tew-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous0016-20080225-awl-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0018-20080318-ymo-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous0019-20080328-drd-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
anonymous0020-20080328-mmv-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0021-20080329-oxi-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0022-20080401-kbc-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
anonymous0023-20080407-gfc-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
anonymous0024-20080407-gvg-a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
anonymous0025-20080408-sqi-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0026-20080413-aso-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0027-20080413-dto-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous0028-20080417-ehq-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous0029-20080417-txe-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous0030-20080419-jam-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0031-20080425-atw-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
anonymous0032-20080428-cxb-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0033-20080428-rfr-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous0034-20080510-kln-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous0035-20080511-noz-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0036-20080517-tca-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0037-20080520-ami-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous0038-20080520-aqx-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous0039-20080520-bmj-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0040-20080520-dqq-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous0041-20080520-lsg-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0042-20080520-qgl-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0043-20080520-wcn-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0044-20080526-rom-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0045-20080527-okm-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
anonymous0046-20080527-pbb-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0047-20080602-ttd-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous0048-20080603-vhl-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous0049-20080605-mcr-b0327 HE HAD SO EASY
anonymous0049-20080605-mcr-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous0049-20080605-mcr-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK

anonymous0050-20080608-dya-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0050-20080608-dya-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0050-20080608-dya-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0050-20080608-dya-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS

anonymous0051-20080608-xxy-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous0051-20080608-xxy-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous0052-20080611-jsf-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous0052-20080611-jsf-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS

anonymous0055-20080621-gtr-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0055-20080621-gtr-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous0055-20080621-gtr-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous0055-20080621-gtr-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous0055-20080621-gtr-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
anonymous0055-20080621-gtr-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous0056-20080621-img-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0056-20080621-img-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM

anonymous0056-20080621-img-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0056-20080621-img-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE

anonymous0059-20080625-qss-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0059-20080625-qss-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous0059-20080625-qss-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE

anonymous0063-20080702-oqm-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous0063-20080702-oqm-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS

anonymous0064-20080702-ucr-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous0064-20080702-ucr-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0065-20080707-rvs-b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES

anonymous0066-20080709-vaq-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0066-20080709-vaq-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous0066-20080709-vaq-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous0066-20080709-vaq-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR

anonymous0068-20080715-zdu-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0068-20080715-zdu-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0068-20080715-zdu-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0068-20080715-zdu-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0068-20080715-zdu-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0068-20080715-zdu-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY

anonymous0072-20080830-zqj-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
anonymous0072-20080830-zqj-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
anonymous0072-20080830-zqj-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS

anonymous0075-20080905-tvm-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0075-20080905-tvm-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous0075-20080905-tvm-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY

anonymous0075-20080905-tvm-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS

anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous0076-20080906-zwn-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
anonymous0077-20080912-cdd-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE

anonymous0077-20080912-cdd-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
anonymous0077-20080912-cdd-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED

anonymous0077-20080912-cdd-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
anonymous0077-20080912-cdd-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT

anonymous0079-20080912-wcp-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous0079-20080912-wcp-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE

anonymous0080-20080913-akr-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0080-20080913-akr-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL

anonymous0082-20080919-xbg-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous0082-20080919-xbg-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous0082-20080919-xbg-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous0083-20080927-shd-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0084-20080929-fuw-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0085-20080929-olb-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0086-20081003-thp-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0087-20081006-yxy-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0088-20081008-hds-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME

anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0089-20081010-uhe-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
anonymous0090-20081014-kvt-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous0091-20081014-pzr-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0092-20081015-rdx-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0093-20081022-apb-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous0093-20081022-apb-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
anonymous0093-20081022-apb-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID

anonymous0093-20081022-apb-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous0093-20081022-apb-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous0093-20081022-apb-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0093-20081022-apb-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0093-20081022-apb-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0094-20081023-jpl-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous0094-20081023-jpl-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF

anonymous0094-20081023-jpl-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0094-20081023-jpl-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0095-20081025-omh-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS

anonymous0095-20081025-omh-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
anonymous0095-20081025-omh-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
anonymous0095-20081025-omh-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous0095-20081025-omh-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous0095-20081025-omh-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous0095-20081025-omh-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL

anonymous0098-20081026-ewe-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous0098-20081026-ewe-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous0098-20081026-ewe-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous0098-20081026-ewe-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous0098-20081026-ewe-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous0099-20081026-qbt-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM

anonymous0117-20081116-pfp-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous0117-20081116-pfp-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0117-20081116-pfp-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous0117-20081116-pfp-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous0118-20081116-xvn-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC

anonymous0120-20081118-ske-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0120-20081118-ske-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE

anonymous0120-20081118-ske-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0120-20081118-ske-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0120-20081118-ske-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0120-20081118-ske-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES

anonymous0121-20081120-knf-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous0121-20081120-knf-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
anonymous0121-20081120-knf-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
anonymous0121-20081120-knf-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
anonymous0121-20081120-knf-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous0121-20081120-knf-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous0121-20081120-knf-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD

anonymous0122-20081123-jam-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous0122-20081123-jam-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous0122-20081123-jam-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous0122-20081123-jam-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous0123-20081124-nrx-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous0123-20081124-nrx-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR

anonymous0123-20081124-nrx-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous0123-20081124-nrx-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous0123-20081124-nrx-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous0123-20081124-nrx-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY

anonymous0124-20081201-kae-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous0124-20081201-kae-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous0124-20081201-kae-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED

anonymous0125-20081208-som-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0125-20081208-som-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0125-20081208-som-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0125-20081208-som-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH

anonymous0126-20081209-vqq-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous0126-20081209-vqq-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous0126-20081209-vqq-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0126-20081209-vqq-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous0128-20081212-mhh-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0129-20081213-xhi-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0130-20081221-htm-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0131-20081225-afe-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0132-20081227-ptr-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0133-20090106-uqf-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous0134-20090116-obg-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous0135-20090117-pzl-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous0136-20090118-cjz-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0137-20090118-wgx-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous0138-20090119-efi-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0139-20090119-qob-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous0140-20090121-bac-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0141-20090121-buj-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
anonymous0142-20090121-cqx-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0143-20090121-cyt-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous0144-20090121-eft-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous0145-20090121-etx-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
anonymous0146-20090121-ifd-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous0147-20090121-ixf-a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous0148-20090121-ncp-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0149-20090121-nik-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous0150-20090121-own-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0151-20090121-pya-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous0152-20090121-rgi-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0153-20090121-slp-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0154-20090121-uax-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous0154-20090121-uax-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous0154-20090121-uax-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL

anonymous0154-20090121-uax-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous0154-20090121-uax-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous0154-20090121-uax-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous0154-20090121-uax-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0154-20090121-uax-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous0155-20090121-ubx-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0156-20090121-wjq-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous0157-20090121-znn-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0158-20090122-aka-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0159-20090201-bel-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous0160-20090201-hjy-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0161-20090201-jtw-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous0162-20090203-rbs-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous0163-20090217-jwf-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous0164-20090218-dec-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0165-20090225-bqo-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET

anonymous0167-20090302-qaf-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous0167-20090302-qaf-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS

anonymous0168-20090302-vai-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0168-20090302-vai-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0168-20090302-vai-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0168-20090302-vai-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND

anonymous0168-20090302-vai-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous0169-20090306-vmr-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous0169-20090306-vmr-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous0169-20090306-vmr-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous0169-20090306-vmr-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous0169-20090306-vmr-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous0169-20090306-vmr-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY

anonymous0170-20090311-icj-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous0170-20090311-icj-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL

anonymous0171-20090312-pmf-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0171-20090312-pmf-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0171-20090312-pmf-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous0172-20090314-nzb-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0172-20090314-nzb-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0172-20090314-nzb-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0172-20090314-nzb-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0172-20090314-nzb-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous0172-20090314-nzb-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY

anonymous0174-20090325-ayb-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous0174-20090325-ayb-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
anonymous0175-20090326-ekm-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE

anonymous0175-20090326-ekm-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous0175-20090326-ekm-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous0175-20090326-ekm-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous0175-20090326-ekm-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous0176-20090406-dtr-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL

anonymous0176-20090406-dtr-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous0176-20090406-dtr-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0176-20090406-dtr-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0176-20090406-dtr-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0176-20090406-dtr-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0177-20090406-evj-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous0177-20090406-evj-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0177-20090406-evj-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous0177-20090406-evj-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS

anonymous0177-20090406-evj-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0177-20090406-evj-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0177-20090406-evj-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0177-20090406-evj-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous0178-20090406-ifh-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI

anonymous0179-20090415-ocs-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous0179-20090415-ocs-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous0180-20090415-xuj-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous0181-20090426-crp-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous0181-20090426-crp-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0181-20090426-crp-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0181-20090426-crp-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0181-20090426-crp-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES

anonymous0181-20090426-crp-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET

anonymous0181-20090426-crp-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous0181-20090426-crp-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION

anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous0182-20090428-uun-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE

anonymous0183-20090430-bme-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0183-20090430-bme-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0183-20090430-bme-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0183-20090430-bme-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0183-20090430-bme-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR

anonymous0183-20090430-bme-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0183-20090430-bme-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0183-20090430-bme-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous0184-20090430-zte-a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous0185-20090506-kns-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN

anonymous0185-20090506-kns-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous0185-20090506-kns-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous0185-20090506-kns-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE

anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0186-20090509-jss-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST

anonymous0187-20090512-ogs-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0187-20090512-ogs-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0187-20090512-ogs-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY

anonymous0187-20090512-ogs-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0187-20090512-ogs-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0188-20090512-yoh-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous0188-20090512-yoh-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous0188-20090512-yoh-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous0188-20090512-yoh-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous0188-20090512-yoh-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE

anonymous0193-20090527-frh-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous0193-20090527-frh-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous0193-20090527-frh-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous0193-20090527-frh-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0193-20090527-frh-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0193-20090527-frh-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous0194-20090527-jyh-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0195-20090528-gzi-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous0196-20090528-ser-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous0197-20090528-sfs-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0198-20090601-zrt-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0199-20090607-fsh-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0200-20090608-hus-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous0201-20090610-lqq-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous0202-20090615-xgs-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0204-20090621-tzs-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0205-20090704-dhe-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anonymous0206-20090704-jan-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0246 HEARD HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
anonymous0207-20090707-ukn-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0208-20090710-rsd-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0209-20090711-asg-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0210-20090711-zqd-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous0211-20090717-rti-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0212-20090720-lcc-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous0213-20090805-eal-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0214-20090806-fmb-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0215-20090806-yeg-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
anonymous0216-20090809-nqo-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0217-20090809-zoh-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous0218-20090813-yzn-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous0219-20090817-vai-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anonymous0220-20090820-hhh-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous0221-20090823-suf-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0195 BUT SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER
anonymous0222-20090825-sqq-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous0223-20090827-hcn-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous0224-20090830-opn-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous0225-20090901-ccb-b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous0226-20090901-fvw-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous0227-20090901-hvd-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous0228-20090901-qkb-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
anonymous0229-20090901-vei-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous0230-20090901-wez-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0231-20090901-xxn-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0232-20090901-yfo-b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous0233-20090902-aad-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous0234-20090902-aku-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous0235-20090902-hct-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous0237-20090905-edk-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous0238-20090906-hdk-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous0239-20090908-gfl-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0240-20090917-aiu-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0241-20090917-bvk-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous0242-20090917-dcv-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0243-20090917-dgm-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0244-20090917-fjn-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
anonymous0245-20090917-frf-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0404 ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0246-20090917-lvy-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
anonymous0247-20090917-mmc-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous0248-20090917-mvg-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous0249-20090917-ppu-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous0250-20090917-puz-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous0251-20090917-sda-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous0251-20090917-sda-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous0251-20090917-sda-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous0251-20090917-sda-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS

anonymous0252-20090917-tgz-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous0252-20090917-tgz-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous0252-20090917-tgz-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous0252-20090917-tgz-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous0253-20090917-vwy-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
anonymous0253-20090917-vwy-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US

anonymous0253-20090917-vwy-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous0253-20090917-vwy-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous0253-20090917-vwy-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous0253-20090917-vwy-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS

anonymous0253-20090917-vwy-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous0254-20090917-xwg-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous0254-20090917-xwg-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous0254-20090917-xwg-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE

anonymous0255-20090917-zsc-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0255-20090917-zsc-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0255-20090917-zsc-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0255-20090917-zsc-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0255-20090917-zsc-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED

anonymous0255-20090917-zsc-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous0256-20090917-ztw-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0257-20090918-wqs-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous0257-20090918-wqs-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous0257-20090918-wqs-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous0257-20090918-wqs-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0257-20090918-wqs-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0257-20090918-wqs-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous0257-20090918-wqs-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous0257-20090918-wqs-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED

anonymous0258-20090919-kwi-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0258-20090919-kwi-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0258-20090919-kwi-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0258-20090919-kwi-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0258-20090919-kwi-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES

anonymous0259-20090919-xjn-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous0259-20090919-xjn-b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME

anonymous0260-20090923-ntq-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous0260-20090923-ntq-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous0260-20090923-ntq-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous0260-20090923-ntq-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous0260-20090923-ntq-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
anonymous0261-20090925-hko-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
anonymous0262-20091001-auy-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous0263-20091007-vwg-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous0264-20091013-icf-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0265-20091025-sap-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous0266-20091027-coy-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0203 SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0206 SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0267-20091029-vql-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0268-20091030-jmb-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0269-20091101-qcf-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous0270-20091102-kue-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0271-20091102-qlq-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous0272-20091102-zha-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous0273-20091103-lwl-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous0274-20091105-jvb-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous0275-20091107-stt-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0276-20091117-gmx-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
anonymous0277-20091125-yll-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous0278-20091204-fqu-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous0278-20091204-fqu-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous0278-20091204-fqu-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0278-20091204-fqu-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous0278-20091204-fqu-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM

anonymous0278-20091204-fqu-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous0278-20091204-fqu-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0278-20091204-fqu-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0279-20091204-ndj-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous0279-20091204-ndj-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous0279-20091204-ndj-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED

anonymous0280-20091209-akg-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous0280-20091209-akg-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0280-20091209-akg-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0280-20091209-akg-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0280-20091209-akg-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0280-20091209-akg-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0280-20091209-akg-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0281-20091209-syp-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST

anonymous0281-20091209-syp-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous0281-20091209-syp-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN

anonymous0281-20091209-syp-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous0281-20091209-syp-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
anonymous0282-20091215-hbw-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous0282-20091215-hbw-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE

anonymous0282-20091215-hbw-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0282-20091215-hbw-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0282-20091215-hbw-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE

anonymous0282-20091215-hbw-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0282-20091215-hbw-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0282-20091215-hbw-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous0283-20091215-jjn-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0284-20091215-qpr-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0306 AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous0285-20091219-amu-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-16 THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-19 THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-20 THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-21 REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0286-20091220-ijn-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous0287-20091220-ngq-b0215 GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0288-20091220-qsv-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous0290-20091221-fbh-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous0291-20091226-cqx-b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0292-20091226-euf-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous0293-20091226-fgl-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous0294-20091226-olz-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous0295-20091226-rsc-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous0296-20091226-tto-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous0297-20091226-vlu-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-02 THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0298-20091227-sns-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
anonymous0299-20091229-exn-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous0300-20091230-cuj-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0301-20091230-xjy-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0266 PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0302-20091231-bfi-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous0303-20100103-epc-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0304-20100106-eyq-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0305-20100106-xov-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
anonymous0305-20100106-xov-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
anonymous0305-20100106-xov-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous0305-20100106-xov-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN

anonymous0310-20100121-upe-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous0310-20100121-upe-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE

anonymous0315-20100202-eeh-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous0315-20100202-eeh-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0315-20100202-eeh-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0315-20100202-eeh-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0315-20100202-eeh-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE

anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous0316-20100202-eia-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous0317-20100202-fzm-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous0318-20100202-irg-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0318-20100202-irg-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0318-20100202-irg-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES

anonymous0318-20100202-irg-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous0318-20100202-irg-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM

anonymous0318-20100202-irg-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anonymous0318-20100202-irg-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
anonymous0319-20100202-nmn-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES

anonymous0319-20100202-nmn-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous0319-20100202-nmn-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous0319-20100202-nmn-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous0320-20100202-pzs-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous0320-20100202-pzs-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous0320-20100202-pzs-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous0320-20100202-pzs-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous0320-20100202-pzs-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION

anonymous0320-20100202-pzs-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous0321-20100202-tcq-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous0322-20100202-tdb-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0323-20100202-umi-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous0324-20100203-ccw-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous0325-20100203-ham-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME

anonymous0328-20100203-sak-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous0328-20100203-sak-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0328-20100203-sak-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous0328-20100203-sak-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous0328-20100203-sak-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous0328-20100203-sak-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0328-20100203-sak-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous0328-20100203-sak-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0329-20100203-snu-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0330-20100203-ssd-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous0331-20100204-aji-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0332-20100204-gym-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous0333-20100204-jll-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0334-20100204-mld-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous0335-20100204-oyj-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous0336-20100204-qck-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0337-20100204-qdn-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous0338-20100204-xyz-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0006 GOD BLESS  I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0339-20100204-yqf-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous0340-20100205-ert-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous0341-20100205-xaw-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous0342-20100206-bhr-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0343-20100207-bse-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous0344-20100208-bzd-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0345-20100208-euy-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0346-20100208-hoy-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
anonymous0347-20100208-ydi-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0010 HE TURNED TO THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD DONE NOT GET YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I EXPECTED
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0018 HE WAS COMPLETELY LOST AT HIS WORK
anonymous0348-20100210-kjh-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGE OF THE TABLE
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
anonymous0349-20100216-ari-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous0350-20100216-kaa-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous0351-20100216-nzx-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY

anonymous0352-20100216-pdt-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous0352-20100216-pdt-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous0352-20100216-pdt-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous0352-20100216-pdt-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0352-20100216-pdt-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0352-20100216-pdt-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0352-20100216-pdt-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY

anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous0353-20100216-stf-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous0354-20100216-tkv-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
anonymous0355-20100216-ynn-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0460 GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous0356-20100218-hww-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
anonymous0357-20100220-kti-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0358-20100221-erv-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous0359-20100221-mhe-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
anonymous0360-20100222-lqr-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0361-20100222-tty-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0362-20100223-yeb-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous0363-20100302-dwg-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0364-20100302-hje-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous0365-20100302-ujr-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous0366-20100304-btb-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous0367-20100308-anr-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous0368-20100311-nos-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous0368-20100311-nos-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous0368-20100311-nos-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES

anonymous0369-20100311-sdi-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0369-20100311-sdi-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0369-20100311-sdi-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0369-20100311-sdi-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE

anonymous0369-20100311-sdi-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0369-20100311-sdi-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous0369-20100311-sdi-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY

anonymous0372-20100316-cns-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous0372-20100316-cns-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous0372-20100316-cns-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous0372-20100316-cns-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
anonymous0373-20100318-ghl-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0374-20100324-xth-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0375-20100328-dly-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous0376-20100328-knh-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0543 CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0544 THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0377-20100330-vye-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
anonymous0378-20100331-sqi-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0494 SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0379-20100405-cmm-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0380-20100418-ajy-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous0381-20100418-kva-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous0382-20100418-tis-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0383-20100418-yup-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0384-20100504-exh-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0385-20100505-bxv-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
anonymous0386-20100508-znh-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0387-20100510-gjx-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous0388-20100511-wmb-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID

anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0389-20100512-ady-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous0390-20100513-yrv-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME

anonymous0391-20100515-nfo-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0392-20100516-oet-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous0393-20100518-qpt-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
anonymous0394-20100523-qls-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0395-20100602-ivg-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0396-20100602-iwp-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
anonymous0397-20100602-jkj-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous0398-20100602-lfk-b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0399-20100602-lnl-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous0400-20100602-mym-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
anonymous0401-20100602-pjw-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous0402-20100602-rwj-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
anonymous0403-20100603-kzj-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous0404-20100604-qub-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0405-20100610-cmu-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous0407-20100610-uyp-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous0408-20100610-vkr-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0409-20100611-gmc-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0259 HE OPENED HER MOUTH BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0266 NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0410-20100619-jfj-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous0411-20100621-cdr-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous0412-20100621-dyw-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
anonymous0413-20100621-ysj-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0414-20100624-iix-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0415-20100624-teo-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous0416-20100629-crb-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous0417-20100629-cxt-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0418-20100703-cvb-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0419-20100708-sqf-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-06 INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0420-20100709-alu-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
anonymous0421-20100709-dlc-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0422-20100709-jrq-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous0423-20100709-yip-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0424-20100710-lyv-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
anonymous0425-20100710-own-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0425-20100710-own-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0425-20100710-own-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
anonymous0425-20100710-own-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0425-20100710-own-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0425-20100710-own-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION

anonymous0425-20100710-own-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0425-20100710-own-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous0426-20100711-sic-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
anonymous0427-20100712-tcc-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0428-20100712-vcz-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous0429-20100712-vfy-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0430-20100716-lmq-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0431-20100719-bon-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
anonymous0432-20100719-jvx-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0433-20100719-vdp-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous0434-20100720-hyh-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE

anonymous0435-20100728-wrt-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous0435-20100728-wrt-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0435-20100728-wrt-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous0435-20100728-wrt-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER

anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous0440-20100809-adw-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous0441-20100810-lli-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous0442-20100810-utr-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE  TYPHOID
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous0443-20100811-ezx-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0444-20100811-gqx-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0445-20100811-jxh-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous0446-20100811-qmw-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
anonymous0447-20100811-smt-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0271 AS CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous0448-20100814-jmp-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous0449-20100819-ltb-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
anonymous0450-20100820-cis-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0451-20100820-dah-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0453-20100820-ebd-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous0454-20100820-hew-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0455-20100820-hpc-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0456-20100820-irk-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0457-20100820-ixc-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous0458-20100820-iyg-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous0459-20100820-kke-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0460-20100820-lka-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0461-20100820-lrw-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0462-20100820-njz-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous0463-20100820-orv-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous0464-20100820-qnp-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
anonymous0465-20100820-vix-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0466-20100820-xmf-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous0467-20100821-bxp-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0468-20100821-dyh-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
anonymous0469-20100821-evl-b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous0470-20100821-fam-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
anonymous0471-20100821-fec-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous0472-20100821-few-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous0473-20100821-gbt-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
anonymous0474-20100821-gus-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0475-20100821-hmj-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0476-20100821-krt-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0476-20100821-krt-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0476-20100821-krt-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0476-20100821-krt-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0476-20100821-krt-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0476-20100821-krt-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous0476-20100821-krt-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
anonymous0477-20100821-kxb-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous0478-20100821-mbm-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0479-20100821-ntp-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0480-20100821-pas-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0017 WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0022 I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IF IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous0481-20100821-rez-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous0482-20100821-ril-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0325 IT WAS A GIANT INADEQUACY
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous0483-20100821-tcb-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous0484-20100821-tjy-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous0485-20100821-tub-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
anonymous0486-20100821-upf-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous0487-20100821-uws-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0488-20100821-wmw-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0489-20100821-xmv-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0490-20100822-eyh-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0491-20100825-hdf-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous0492-20100825-jjn-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
anonymous0493-20100827-twy-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0494-20100828-qtg-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR

anonymous0495-20100828-zmr-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous0495-20100828-zmr-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
anonymous0495-20100828-zmr-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
anonymous0495-20100828-zmr-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
anonymous0495-20100828-zmr-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
anonymous0495-20100828-zmr-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous0495-20100828-zmr-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous0496-20100909-dsp-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0496-20100909-dsp-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0496-20100909-dsp-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous0496-20100909-dsp-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous0496-20100909-dsp-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous0496-20100909-dsp-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM

anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0047 BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
anonymous0497-20101011-mld-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous0498-20101011-pme-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous0499-20101011-qrd-a0385 CARNEGIE DID

anonymous0499-20101011-qrd-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0499-20101011-qrd-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0499-20101011-qrd-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0499-20101011-qrd-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0499-20101011-qrd-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous0499-20101011-qrd-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous0499-20101011-qrd-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0500-20101011-tsg-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
anonymous0501-20101016-xhw-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous0502-20101019-nhu-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
anonymous0503-20101023-ntp-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous0504-20101030-emu-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0505-20101030-xxn-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0506-20101105-cvd-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous0507-20101108-asx-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous0508-20101110-cpo-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0509-20101110-wkc-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0510-20101111-rcg-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous0511-20101112-hep-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous0512-20101116-tfq-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous0513-20101117-jnw-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0514-20101117-yrd-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous0516-20101206-fjf-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0517-20101207-cjw-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous0518-20101207-fax-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
anonymous0519-20101207-wit-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0520-20101211-mgx-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous0521-20101212-nlp-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0522-20101214-naa-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous0523-20101215-kqj-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID
anonymous0524-20101218-jcp-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous0525-20101222-tsc-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0526-20110102-rco-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous0527-20110102-ufy-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous0528-20110102-vja-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous0529-20110102-wsm-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0530-20110107-bbn-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA

anonymous0540-20110206-hgm-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous0540-20110206-hgm-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
anonymous0540-20110206-hgm-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
anonymous0540-20110206-hgm-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
anonymous0540-20110206-hgm-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
anonymous0540-20110206-hgm-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE

anonymous0541-20110206-hyx-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS

anonymous0542-20110209-xtb-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0542-20110209-xtb-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0542-20110209-xtb-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0542-20110209-xtb-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0542-20110209-xtb-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0542-20110209-xtb-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0542-20110209-xtb-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT

anonymous0543-20110210-rjz-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous0543-20110210-rjz-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous0543-20110210-rjz-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous0543-20110210-rjz-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous0543-20110210-rjz-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
anonymous0543-20110210-rjz-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
anonymous0543-20110210-rjz-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous0543-20110210-rjz-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous0544-20110210-vsw-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE

anonymous0544-20110210-vsw-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous0544-20110210-vsw-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous0544-20110210-vsw-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE

anonymous0545-20110214-lko-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous0545-20110214-lko-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous0545-20110214-lko-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous0545-20110214-lko-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous0545-20110214-lko-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME

anonymous0545-20110214-lko-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous0545-20110214-lko-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous0545-20110214-lko-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
anonymous0546-20110215-eqq-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
anonymous0547-20110219-ppv-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous0547-20110219-ppv-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous0547-20110219-ppv-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
anonymous0547-20110219-ppv-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
anonymous0547-20110219-ppv-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous0547-20110219-ppv-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous0547-20110219-ppv-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous0547-20110219-ppv-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST

anonymous0548-20110221-djy-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous0548-20110221-djy-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
anonymous0548-20110221-djy-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
anonymous0548-20110221-djy-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL

anonymous0553-20110310-gxc-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0553-20110310-gxc-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0553-20110310-gxc-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0553-20110310-gxc-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0553-20110310-gxc-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0553-20110310-gxc-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0553-20110310-gxc-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0554-20110310-itc-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0555-20110312-bqz-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0556-20110312-hkp-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0557-20110312-wbu-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous0558-20110314-wdi-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
anonymous0559-20110315-kjw-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous0560-20110316-hjh-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
anonymous0561-20110320-kvz-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0562-20110323-qed-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous0563-20110328-fwc-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0564-20110328-mng-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous0565-20110328-yam-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous0566-20110331-ons-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0567-20110406-opo-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0568-20110410-iey-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous0569-20110411-ymk-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
anonymous0570-20110412-oap-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0570-20110412-oap-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0570-20110412-oap-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW

anonymous0570-20110412-oap-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous0570-20110412-oap-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON

anonymous0570-20110412-oap-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0571-20110413-mnn-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous0571-20110413-mnn-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous0571-20110413-mnn-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous0571-20110413-mnn-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous0571-20110413-mnn-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous0571-20110413-mnn-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous0571-20110413-mnn-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
anonymous0571-20110413-mnn-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID

anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
anonymous0572-20110423-jiq-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous0573-20110424-pzj-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous0574-20110429-kgd-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
anonymous0575-20110429-oog-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
anonymous0575-20110429-oog-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
anonymous0575-20110429-oog-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT

anonymous0575-20110429-oog-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous0575-20110429-oog-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous0575-20110429-oog-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous0575-20110429-oog-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous0575-20110429-oog-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous0576-20110429-vab-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous0576-20110429-vab-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
anonymous0576-20110429-vab-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous0576-20110429-vab-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous0576-20110429-vab-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED

anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0577-20110502-hqq-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0578-20110502-kfs-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0578-20110502-kfs-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous0578-20110502-kfs-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous0578-20110502-kfs-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0578-20110502-kfs-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0578-20110502-kfs-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0578-20110502-kfs-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK

anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0579-20110514-pws-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED

anonymous0580-20110514-sdj-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0580-20110514-sdj-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0581-20110517-rfb-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0582-20110522-cyl-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous0582-20110522-cyl-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0582-20110522-cyl-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0582-20110522-cyl-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0582-20110522-cyl-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0582-20110522-cyl-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0582-20110522-cyl-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0582-20110522-cyl-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED

anonymous0583-20110603-gmi-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous0583-20110603-gmi-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous0583-20110603-gmi-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous0583-20110603-gmi-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous0583-20110603-gmi-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0584-20110605-ocx-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0585-20110612-gpc-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0586-20110614-fee-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0587-20110622-neb-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous0588-20110629-eif-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
anonymous0589-20110629-kpn-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0590-20110709-etv-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous0591-20110709-hjc-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous0592-20110709-hlk-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous0593-20110802-dgv-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0594-20110803-isj-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
anonymous0595-20110803-tdn-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT

anonymous0596-20110815-egr-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0596-20110815-egr-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0596-20110815-egr-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0596-20110815-egr-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU

anonymous0596-20110815-egr-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0596-20110815-egr-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous0597-20110815-oow-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0598-20110815-sgs-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous0599-20110815-uxr-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous0600-20110823-iqv-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous0601-20110825-eix-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous0602-20110826-ooy-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous0603-20110826-qjl-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous0604-20110826-tux-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
anonymous0605-20110826-vgx-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous0606-20110830-ydz-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
anonymous0607-20110831-udn-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0608-20110907-cgh-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous0609-20110910-vxz-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous0610-20110914-cym-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0611-20110916-slf-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous0612-20110920-jvq-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous0613-20110925-bza-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous0614-20110926-axo-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0615-20110926-fnk-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
anonymous0616-20110926-nnd-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0617-20110926-qeo-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0618-20110926-zwj-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE

anonymous0619-20110927-cqd-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous0619-20110927-cqd-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous0619-20110927-cqd-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous0619-20110927-cqd-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0620-20110928-spu-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0620-20110928-spu-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous0620-20110928-spu-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous0620-20110928-spu-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT

anonymous0620-20110928-spu-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL

anonymous0623-20111005-fot-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous0623-20111005-fot-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0623-20111005-fot-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0623-20111005-fot-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0623-20111005-fot-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0623-20111005-fot-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0623-20111005-fot-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING

anonymous0624-20111006-jpt-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous0624-20111006-jpt-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0624-20111006-jpt-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0624-20111006-jpt-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0624-20111006-jpt-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0624-20111006-jpt-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0624-20111006-jpt-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0625-20111006-vzi-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER

anonymous0625-20111006-vzi-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous0625-20111006-vzi-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous0626-20111008-vqf-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous0627-20111008-yun-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0628-20111010-elh-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous0629-20111014-lbr-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous0630-20111017-svc-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
anonymous0631-20111018-pnv-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous0632-20111021-emo-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0633-20111023-wjo-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
anonymous0634-20111028-bgn-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous0635-20111028-uvj-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous0636-20111028-wrq-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous0637-20111029-asr-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0638-20111029-gan-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous0639-20111029-htk-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0640-20111029-ihf-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous0641-20111029-jsf-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous0642-20111029-lve-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
anonymous0643-20111029-ofb-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0644-20111029-ptj-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous0645-20111029-rer-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0646-20111029-rrz-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
anonymous0647-20111029-uaw-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous0648-20111029-yxq-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous0649-20111030-ebn-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0650-20111030-fki-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0651-20111030-vyy-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0652-20111030-wnu-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous0653-20111031-mgt-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0401 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0402 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0403 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0404 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous0654-20111031-wyu-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous0655-20111102-hng-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous0655-20111102-hng-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous0655-20111102-hng-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous0655-20111102-hng-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous0655-20111102-hng-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous0655-20111102-hng-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0655-20111102-hng-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0656-20111104-kry-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0657-20111104-mmn-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous0658-20111104-tik-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous0659-20111106-crv-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0660-20111106-ndu-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0661-20111109-pqi-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0662-20111111-uqq-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous0663-20111114-dzk-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous0664-20111114-tzv-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0664-20111114-tzv-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0664-20111114-tzv-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous0664-20111114-tzv-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous0664-20111114-tzv-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous0664-20111114-tzv-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT

anonymous0665-20111115-uzp-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous0665-20111115-uzp-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0665-20111115-uzp-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0665-20111115-uzp-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous0665-20111115-uzp-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous0665-20111115-uzp-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous0665-20111115-uzp-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous0665-20111115-uzp-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING

anonymous0666-20111121-qqi-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous0666-20111121-qqi-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous0666-20111121-qqi-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous0666-20111121-qqi-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF

anonymous0667-20111121-quz-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous0668-20111121-zht-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
anonymous0668-20111121-zht-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE

anonymous0668-20111121-zht-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous0668-20111121-zht-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous0668-20111121-zht-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous0669-20111129-eys-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
anonymous0670-20111129-htp-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
anonymous0671-20111130-dzs-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous0672-20111202-etx-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0447 IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
anonymous0673-20111207-qbi-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
anonymous0674-20111212-amw-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
anonymous0675-20111214-opj-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0676-20111214-tdu-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0677-20111217-ghn-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0678-20111219-uli-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES PERIOD
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED PERIOD
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW PERIOD
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT PERIOD
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL PERIOD
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY PERIOD
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME COMMA SIR COMMA THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE PERIOD
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY PERIOD
anonymous0679-20111229-nyb-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT PERIOD
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0680-20111230-bqh-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
anonymous0681-20120102-ysj-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
anonymous0682-20120108-npv-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
anonymous0683-20120108-pso-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
anonymous0684-20120108-ros-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0685-20120116-kkk-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
anonymous0686-20120116-noi-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous0687-20120116-oxe-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0190 TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0688-20120118-mwk-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0689-20120119-wha-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0690-20120119-wrs-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous0691-20120119-xpz-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous0692-20120121-qjw-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous0693-20120123-smu-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous0694-20120131-wfk-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0695-20120202-wod-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0697-20120213-esv-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0697-20120213-esv-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0697-20120213-esv-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0697-20120213-esv-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0697-20120213-esv-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES

anonymous0698-20120214-hmf-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous0698-20120214-hmf-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous0698-20120214-hmf-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous0698-20120214-hmf-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
anonymous0698-20120214-hmf-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO

anonymous0699-20120214-uls-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0699-20120214-uls-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG

anonymous0699-20120214-uls-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0699-20120214-uls-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0699-20120214-uls-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND

anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0700-20120219-aph-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0701-20120219-qvz-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED

anonymous0701-20120219-qvz-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0702-20120220-tcc-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous0702-20120220-tcc-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM

anonymous0702-20120220-tcc-b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
anonymous0702-20120220-tcc-b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK

anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous0703-20120221-sji-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR

anonymous0705-20120226-czq-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
anonymous0705-20120226-czq-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
anonymous0705-20120226-czq-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
anonymous0706-20120301-zug-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
anonymous0706-20120301-zug-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
anonymous0706-20120301-zug-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT

anonymous0706-20120301-zug-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0706-20120301-zug-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous0706-20120301-zug-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0707-20120302-psz-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
anonymous0708-20120302-whq-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES

anonymous0709-20120302-zyn-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0709-20120302-zyn-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0709-20120302-zyn-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous0710-20120306-shm-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0711-20120306-wee-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
anonymous0712-20120312-ksx-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
anonymous0713-20120317-bth-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0714-20120317-piz-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0715-20120326-gqx-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous0716-20120326-jfz-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0717-20120326-jme-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
anonymous0718-20120326-yiz-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0719-20120330-plp-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0720-20120404-jbz-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
anonymous0721-20120406-csu-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0722-20120408-erw-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous0723-20120410-thd-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY

anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
anonymous0724-20120411-afn-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0725-20120412-jpg-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous0726-20120417-ceg-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0727-20120417-dwv-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous0728-20120423-liq-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0729-20120427-msw-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
anonymous0729-20120427-msw-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous0729-20120427-msw-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0729-20120427-msw-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous0729-20120427-msw-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous0729-20120427-msw-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous0729-20120427-msw-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0729-20120427-msw-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED

anonymous0730-20120430-hav-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0730-20120430-hav-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0730-20120430-hav-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU

anonymous0731-20120430-kmg-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous0731-20120430-kmg-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0731-20120430-kmg-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0731-20120430-kmg-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0731-20120430-kmg-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0731-20120430-kmg-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0731-20120430-kmg-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING

anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous0732-20120430-nio-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous0733-20120430-tej-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
anonymous0734-20120504-gmt-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
anonymous0735-20120504-xqm-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
anonymous0736-20120505-tat-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0737-20120508-chd-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous0738-20120508-gjp-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0739-20120511-zwb-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0740-20120512-fya-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
anonymous0741-20120512-nli-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0742-20120518-vwq-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous0743-20120601-hxs-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0744-20120602-jsh-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous0745-20120602-lbi-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
anonymous0746-20120602-nvp-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous0747-20120602-vau-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous0748-20120603-fbx-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0749-20120603-xzu-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0750-20120607-qse-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous0751-20120607-rmv-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
anonymous0752-20120607-unb-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
anonymous0753-20120607-ylp-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
anonymous0754-20120615-een-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous0754-20120615-een-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous0754-20120615-een-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED

anonymous0776-20120805-gcr-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0776-20120805-gcr-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0776-20120805-gcr-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0776-20120805-gcr-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
anonymous0776-20120805-gcr-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0777-20120805-twm-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
anonymous0778-20120810-nuq-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0779-20120810-pbo-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous0780-20120831-zey-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous0781-20120906-kow-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGING
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0782-20120907-txv-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0783-20120910-asr-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0784-20120910-qkq-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous0785-20120913-ikd-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0786-20120922-dsx-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
anonymous0787-20120922-ydr-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
anonymous0788-20120924-nrn-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous0789-20120926-ktd-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
anonymous0790-20120926-rbh-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous0791-20120926-sox-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0792-20120926-xtm-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0206 HE SAYS HE BROUGHT BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU

anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0793-20121004-qtp-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0794-20121006-jhy-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0794-20121006-jhy-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous0794-20121006-jhy-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous0794-20121006-jhy-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY

anonymous0794-20121006-jhy-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous0795-20121010-cxw-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous0795-20121010-cxw-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous0795-20121010-cxw-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous0795-20121010-cxw-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous0795-20121010-cxw-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous0795-20121010-cxw-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
anonymous0795-20121010-cxw-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL

anonymous0796-20121011-hkf-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0796-20121011-hkf-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0796-20121011-hkf-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE

anonymous0797-20121011-hxt-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0797-20121011-hxt-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0797-20121011-hxt-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0797-20121011-hxt-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0797-20121011-hxt-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0797-20121011-hxt-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0797-20121011-hxt-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous0797-20121011-hxt-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR

anonymous0798-20121012-dhx-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
anonymous0798-20121012-dhx-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
anonymous0798-20121012-dhx-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
anonymous0798-20121012-dhx-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
anonymous0798-20121012-dhx-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
anonymous0798-20121012-dhx-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
anonymous0798-20121012-dhx-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous0799-20121014-mep-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0800-20121015-bum-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0801-20121015-gji-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
anonymous0802-20121015-jrn-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
anonymous0803-20121015-uiv-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
anonymous0804-20121018-clm-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0805-20121018-ycw-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
anonymous0806-20121022-nxo-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0807-20121023-gfg-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous0808-20121026-gma-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0809-20121028-ohv-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
anonymous0810-20121110-hcr-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
anonymous0811-20121112-qad-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous0812-20121113-hah-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0813-20121113-jbs-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0006 GOD BLESS EM I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0814-20121113-lln-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
anonymous0815-20121113-lub-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous0816-20121113-miv-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
anonymous0817-20121113-olg-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
anonymous0818-20121114-jld-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous0819-20121114-ydk-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0820-20121115-nkb-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
anonymous0821-20121118-aqi-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0092 DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
anonymous0822-20121120-jtl-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous0823-20121120-vng-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
anonymous0824-20121126-lkp-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0825-20121127-brr-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous0826-20121128-lxx-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
anonymous0827-20121130-cao-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0828-20121207-caj-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0829-20121210-eqe-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN RUNNING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
anonymous0830-20121211-qbw-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
anonymous0831-20121218-lon-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0832-20121228-ljx-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0833-20121228-ukp-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
anonymous0834-20121230-jlj-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous0835-20121230-ksv-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
anonymous0836-20121231-wrw-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous0837-20130110-gdh-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous0838-20130119-iyt-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0839-20130123-ahj-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0840-20130123-jta-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
anonymous0841-20130131-wxu-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous0842-20130208-fvq-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0844-20130219-ssc-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous0844-20130219-ssc-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY

anonymous0844-20130219-ssc-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
anonymous0844-20130219-ssc-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
anonymous0844-20130219-ssc-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
anonymous0844-20130219-ssc-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
anonymous0844-20130219-ssc-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
anonymous0844-20130219-ssc-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
anonymous0845-20130224-nwg-a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0846-20130226-cyt-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous0847-20130304-xkn-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0848-20130309-juw-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING

anonymous0849-20130309-trq-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0849-20130309-trq-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0849-20130309-trq-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0849-20130309-trq-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0849-20130309-trq-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK

anonymous0849-20130309-trq-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0849-20130309-trq-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0849-20130309-trq-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP

anonymous0850-20130409-hrd-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0851-20130409-htd-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
anonymous0851-20130409-htd-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE

anonymous0852-20130411-mdo-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous0852-20130411-mdo-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous0852-20130411-mdo-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND

anonymous0853-20130411-wdb-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0853-20130411-wdb-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous0853-20130411-wdb-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous0853-20130411-wdb-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous0854-20130413-lye-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE

anonymous0854-20130413-lye-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0854-20130413-lye-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous0854-20130413-lye-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous0854-20130413-lye-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM

anonymous0855-20130426-tqu-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0855-20130426-tqu-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0855-20130426-tqu-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0855-20130426-tqu-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
anonymous0855-20130426-tqu-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0855-20130426-tqu-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0856-20130430-ibm-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
anonymous0856-20130430-ibm-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE

anonymous0856-20130430-ibm-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous0856-20130430-ibm-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous0857-20130504-tht-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
anonymous0857-20130504-tht-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
anonymous0857-20130504-tht-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
anonymous0857-20130504-tht-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT

anonymous0857-20130504-tht-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
anonymous0857-20130504-tht-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
anonymous0858-20130510-mrm-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
anonymous0858-20130510-mrm-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT

anonymous0858-20130510-mrm-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous0858-20130510-mrm-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous0858-20130510-mrm-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0858-20130510-mrm-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT

anonymous0859-20130516-wkd-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
anonymous0859-20130516-wkd-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
anonymous0859-20130516-wkd-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
anonymous0860-20130527-qpa-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous0860-20130527-qpa-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous0860-20130527-qpa-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous0860-20130527-qpa-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
anonymous0860-20130527-qpa-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous0860-20130527-qpa-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous0860-20130527-qpa-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED

anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
anonymous0861-20130604-ilh-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE

anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
anonymous0862-20130608-kxt-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
anonymous0863-20130608-tpg-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM

anonymous0863-20130608-tpg-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0863-20130608-tpg-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0863-20130608-tpg-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0863-20130608-tpg-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME

anonymous0865-20130610-rjy-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
anonymous0865-20130610-rjy-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
anonymous0865-20130610-rjy-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
anonymous0865-20130610-rjy-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
anonymous0865-20130610-rjy-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
anonymous0865-20130610-rjy-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous0866-20130615-bfi-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
anonymous0867-20130618-ecx-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
anonymous0868-20130618-wpr-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0869-20130623-htg-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0870-20130626-ilf-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0871-20130626-ulm-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
anonymous0872-20130701-gef-a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0340 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0341 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0873-20130703-jzv-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0874-20130717-cyu-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous0875-20130717-gqf-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0876-20130717-kqk-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
anonymous0877-20130717-sot-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
anonymous0878-20130717-zwr-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
anonymous0879-20130721-kon-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
anonymous0880-20130805-qmz-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0881-20130812-cjv-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
anonymous0882-20130814-lnj-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0883-20130824-bdm-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0884-20130824-fnv-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
anonymous0885-20130824-iex-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
anonymous0886-20130824-lpn-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
anonymous0887-20130824-ntg-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
anonymous0888-20130902-ddm-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
anonymous0889-20130906-ocl-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
anonymous0890-20130908-vub-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0891-20130915-ypw-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0892-20130916-oas-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
anonymous0893-20130925-cex-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous0894-20131014-fgn-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0895-20131025-rfg-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0896-20131026-htq-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous0897-20131028-wev-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
anonymous0898-20131029-wcc-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
anonymous0899-20131104-anr-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0900-20131104-fev-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
anonymous0901-20131113-hvx-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
anonymous0902-20131114-wai-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
anonymous0903-20131120-mgm-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
anonymous0904-20131129-aca-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
anonymous0905-20131203-gjy-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0906-20131212-bmx-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
anonymous0907-20131217-aha-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0908-20131218-tdo-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
anonymous0909-20140102-apa-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous0910-20140102-opt-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
anonymous0911-20140102-qou-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
anonymous0912-20140104-cje-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
anonymous0913-20140104-wcg-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous0914-20140104-zxf-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0915-20140107-frd-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0916-20140108-eyp-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
anonymous0917-20140108-jfd-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0918-20140108-yix-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
anonymous0919-20140125-pfd-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0920-20140130-wdf-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0921-20140304-khk-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous0922-20140308-joi-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
anonymous0923-20140308-uoq-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
anonymous0924-20140316-fkx-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0925-20140316-pbz-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
anonymous0926-20140330-iuh-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
anonymous0927-20140402-xkc-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
anonymous0928-20140506-ime-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
anonymous0929-20140508-avt-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
anonymous0930-20140509-vjj-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
anonymous0931-20140519-hpg-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
anonymous0932-20140522-wgm-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0484 NO SIR EE
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
anonymous0933-20140531-jzc-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
anonymous0934-20140601-gxh-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
anonymous0935-20140601-irn-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
anonymous0936-20140601-qsa-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
anonymous0937-20140601-rup-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
anonymous0938-20140601-vzi-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
anonymous0939-20140729-bee-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
anonymous0940-20140729-bnk-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0541 WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0941-20140729-cxx-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous0942-20140729-heh-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
anonymous0943-20140729-ipn-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
anonymous0944-20140729-qyl-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
anonymous0945-20140729-yrm-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous0946-20140819-qvh-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0006 GOD BLESS EM I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
anonymous0947-20141002-qgp-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0948-20141005-gha-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
anonymous0949-20141005-zhl-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
anonymous0950-20141008-ckv-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0329 AH INDEED
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
anonymous0951-20141029-pyl-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
anonymous0952-20141124-qva-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
anonymous0953-20141201-rie-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
anonymous0954-20141201-vaf-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
anonymous0955-20141215-bme-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
anonymous0956-20150102-ekb-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
anonymous0957-20150102-hhn-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
anonymous0958-20150109-mlr-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous0959-20150121-dot-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
anonymous0960-20150128-elb-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
anonymous0961-20150128-ufr-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
anonymous0962-20150204-skc-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous0963-20150227-gzc-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0964-20150227-ney-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0965-20150303-mil-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
anonymous0966-20150317-dgc-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0967-20150410-avs-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
anonymous0968-20150414-wak-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0969-20150417-qko-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
anonymous0970-20150512-eab-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
anonymous0972-20150512-pzo-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
anonymous0973-20150512-taa-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
anonymous0974-20150603-okn-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
anonymous0975-20150603-wnu-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
anonymous0976-20150824-pcq-a0176 HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous0976-20150824-pcq-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED

anonymous0977-25561208-ayf-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM

anonymous0977-25561208-ayf-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE

anonymous0977-25561208-ayf-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
anonymous0977-25561208-ayf-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN

ariyan-20120801-gra-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
ariyan-20120801-gra-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
ariyan-20120801-gra-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
ariyan-20120801-gra-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
arjuan-20100820-acz-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
arjuan-20100820-acz-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT

asladic-20100311-bfp-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
asladic-20100311-bfp-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
asladic-20100311-bfp-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
asladic-20100311-bfp-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
asladic-20100311-bfp-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
asladic-20100311-bfp-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW

asladic-20100311-bfp-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
asladic-20100311-bfp-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
asladic-20100311-bfp-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
asladic-20100311-tjx-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE

asladic-20100311-tjx-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON

asp-20091228-inn-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
asp-20091228-inn-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
asp-20091228-inn-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
asp-20091228-inn-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
asp-20091228-inn-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
asp-20091228-inn-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
asp-20091228-inn-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
asp-20091228-inn-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS

asp-20091228-qtl-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
asp-20091228-qtl-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
asp-20091228-qtl-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
asp-20091228-qtl-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
asp-20091228-qtl-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG

asp-20091228-qtl-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
avsa242-20071208-cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
avsa242-20071208-cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
avsa242-20071208-cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
avsa242-20071208-cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
avsa242-20071208-cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
avsa242-20071208-cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
avsa242-20071208-cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
avsa242-20071208-cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
avsa242-20071208-cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
avsa242-20071208-cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
avsa242-20071208-cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
avsa242-20071208-cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
avsa242-20071208-cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
avsa242-20071208-cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
avsa242-20071208-cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
avsa242-20071208-cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
avsa242-20071208-cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
avsa242-20071208-cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
avsa242-20071208-cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
avsa242-20071208-cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
avsa242-20071208-cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
avsa242-20071208-cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
avsa242-20071208-cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
avsa242-20071208-cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
avsa242-20071208-cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
avsa242-20071208-cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
avsa242-20071208-cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
avsa242-20071208-cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
avsa242-20071208-cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
avsa242-20071208-cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
avsa242-20071208-cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
avsa242-20071208-cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER
avsa242-20071208-cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE

azmisov-20140428-cyp-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
azmisov-20140428-cyp-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL

azmisov-20140428-cyp-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
azmisov-20140428-cyp-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
azmisov-20140428-cyp-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
azmisov-20140428-cyp-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
azmisov-20140428-cyp-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
azmisov-20140428-gjh-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0351 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
azmisov-20140428-hgh-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
azmisov-20140428-kfo-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
azmisov-20140428-mjz-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
azmisov-20140428-ovn-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
azmisov-20140428-pdb-b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
azmisov-20140428-tqh-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
azmisov-20140428-tth-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
azmisov-20140428-wjm-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
azmisov-20140428-xml-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
azmisov-20140430-mqe-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
bachroxx-20080119-tuu-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
bart-20090807-ufp-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
bart-20090807-ufp-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
bart-20090807-ufp-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
bart-20090807-ufp-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
bart-20090807-ufp-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
bart-20090807-ufp-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
bart-20090807-ufp-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
bart-20090807-ufp-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
bart-20090807-ufp-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
bart-20090807-ufp-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
becz03-20121205-ixj-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
becz03-20121205-xvx-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
becz03-20121205-yzd-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
beez1717-20111017-yqm-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
belmontguy-20110426-geu-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
ben-20090326-cpr-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
ben-20090326-cpr-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
ben-20090326-cpr-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
ben-20090326-cpr-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
ben-20090326-cpr-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
ben-20090326-cpr-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
ben-20090326-cpr-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
ben-20090326-cpr-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
ben-20090326-cpr-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
ben-20090326-cpr-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
ben-20090326-hxc-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
ben-20090326-hxc-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME

ben-20090326-hxc-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
ben-20090326-hxc-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
ben-20090326-hxc-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
ben-20090326-njk-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
ben-20090326-njk-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
ben-20090326-njk-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
ben-20090326-njk-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM

ben-20090326-njk-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
bendra-20141108-xnz-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
benkay-20090111-ar-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER
benkay-20090111-cc-cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE

benkay-20090111-rp-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
benkay-20090111-rp-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
bhart-20100106-djk-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
bhart-20100106-djk-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS

bhart-20100106-giy-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
bhart-20100106-giy-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
bhart-20100106-giy-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
bhart-20100106-giy-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
bhart-20100106-giy-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
bhart-20100106-giy-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
bhart-20100106-giy-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
bhart-20100106-giy-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
bhart-20100106-giy-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
bhart-20100106-giy-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
bhart-20100106-joc-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
bhart-20100106-joc-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
bhart-20100106-joc-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
bhart-20100106-joc-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
bhart-20100106-joc-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
bhart-20100106-joc-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
bhart-20100106-joc-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
bhart-20100106-joc-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
bhart-20100106-joc-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
bhart-20100106-joc-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
bhart-20100106-jot-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
bhart-20100106-jot-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
bhart-20100106-jot-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
bhart-20100106-jot-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
bhart-20100106-jot-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
bhart-20100106-jot-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
bhart-20100106-jot-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
bhart-20100106-jot-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
bhart-20100106-jot-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
bhart-20100106-jot-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
bhart-20100106-kab-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
bhart-20100106-kab-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
bhart-20100106-kab-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
bhart-20100106-kab-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
bhart-20100106-kab-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
bhart-20100106-kab-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
bhart-20100106-kab-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
bhart-20100106-kab-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
bhart-20100106-kab-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
bhart-20100106-kab-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
bhart-20100106-ldp-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
bhart-20100106-ldp-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
bhart-20100106-ldp-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
bhart-20100106-mal-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
bhart-20100106-mal-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
bhart-20100106-mal-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
bhart-20100106-mal-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
bhart-20100106-mal-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
bhart-20100106-mal-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
bhart-20100106-mal-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
bhart-20100106-mal-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
bhart-20100106-mal-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
bhart-20100106-mal-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
bhart-20100106-qib-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
bhart-20100106-qib-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
bhart-20100106-qib-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
bhart-20100106-qib-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
bhart-20100106-qib-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
bhart-20100106-qib-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
bhart-20100106-qib-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
bhart-20100106-qib-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
bhart-20100106-qib-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
bhart-20100106-qib-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0582 THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
bhart-20100106-yty-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
bhart-20100106-yty-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
bhart-20100106-yty-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
bhart-20100106-yty-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
bhart-20100106-yty-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
bhart-20100106-yty-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
bhart-20100106-yty-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
bhart-20100106-yty-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
bhart-20100106-yty-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
bhart-20100106-yty-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
bhart-20100108-hch-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
bhart-20100108-hch-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
bhart-20100108-hch-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
bhart-20100108-hch-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
bhart-20100108-hch-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
bhart-20100108-hch-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
bhart-20100108-hch-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
bhart-20100108-hch-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
bhart-20100108-hch-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
bhart-20100108-hch-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
bigmbywater-20100821-atk-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
bigmbywater-20100821-wsn-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
bloomtom-20080612-mvm-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
bloomtom-20080612-pfg-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB

bloomtom-20080612-stx-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
bloomtom-20080612-stx-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
bloomtom-20080612-stx-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
bloomtom-20080612-stx-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
bloomtom-20080612-stx-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
bloomtom-20080612-stx-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
bloomtom-20080612-stx-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE

bloomtom-20080612-vya-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS

bloomtom-20080612-vya-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0411 BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0412 IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
bluSch-20100525-bqg-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0001 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0002 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF LIGHT WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0003 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0004 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0005 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0006 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0007 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0008 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0009 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATIONS TO THE HEBREWS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0010 IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0011 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0012 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0013 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0014 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0015 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION BUT REFRACTION
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0016 BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0017 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0018 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0019 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF SUPER IMPOSITION
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0020 OF A NUMBER OF BOWS IF THE RED
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0021 OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST THE
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0022 RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH A ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0023 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0024 THIS IS NOT THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW
bluefox83-20080413-bwq-rai0025 ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE

bobriva123-20100611-cuz-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
bobriva123-20100611-cuz-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION

brad-20081015-xdf-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
brad-20081015-xdf-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE

brad-20100823-tki-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
brad-20100823-tki-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
brad-20100823-tki-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
brad-20100823-tki-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
brad-20100823-tki-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
brad-20100823-tki-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
brad-20100823-tki-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
brad-20100823-tki-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
brad-20100823-tki-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
brdmb-20080603-mbr-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
brdmb-20080603-pas-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
brdmb-20080603-uhv-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
brdmb-20080603-zvi-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
brdmb-20080721-cwt-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
brdmb-20080721-zhn-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
bread555-20100821-pyw-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
bread555-20100821-vqd-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
btr-20090830-jgd-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
btr-20090830-msm-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
btr-20090830-msm-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB

btr-20090830-msm-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
btr-20090830-msm-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
btr-20090830-msm-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
btr-20090830-utt-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
btr-20090830-utt-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
btr-20090830-utt-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
btr-20090830-utt-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
btr-20090830-utt-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
btr-20090830-utt-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
btr-20090830-utt-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED

bugsysservant-20091103-bhy-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
bugsysservant-20091103-bhy-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
bugsysservant-20091103-bwz-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU

bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
bugsysservant-20091103-cob-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
bugsysservant-20091103-dro-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
bugsysservant-20091103-emm-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
bugsysservant-20091103-fic-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
bugsysservant-20091103-ilf-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
bugsysservant-20091103-mun-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
bugsysservant-20091103-qwg-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
bugsysservant-20091103-tsb-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
bugsysservant-20091103-uhs-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
bugsysservant-20091103-vlb-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
bugsysservant-20091103-vrd-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
bugsysservant-20091103-vyn-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
bugsysservant-20091103-wfn-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
bugsysservant-20091103-xxr-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
bugsysservant-20091103-xxr-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
bugsysservant-20091103-xxr-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
bugsysservant-20091103-xxr-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
bugsysservant-20091103-xxr-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
bugsysservant-20091103-xxr-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
bugsysservant-20091103-xxr-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
bugsysservant-20091103-xxr-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE

bugsysservant-20091103-yxr-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION

bugsysservant-20091103-yxr-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
bugsysservant-20091103-yxr-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
bugsysservant-20091104-jed-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
bugsysservant-20091104-jed-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
bugsysservant-20091104-jed-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
bugsysservant-20091104-jed-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID

bugsysservant-20091104-jed-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
bugsysservant-20091104-jed-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
bugsysservant-20091104-jed-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED

bugsysservant-20091104-kan-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
bugsysservant-20091104-kan-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
bugsysservant-20091104-kan-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
bugsysservant-20091104-kan-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
bugsysservant-20091104-kan-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
bugsysservant-20091104-kan-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
bugsysservant-20091104-kan-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
bugsysservant-20091104-rit-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
bugsysservant-20091104-rit-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
bugsysservant-20091104-rit-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
bugsysservant-20091104-rit-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
bugsysservant-20091104-rit-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
bugsysservant-20091104-rit-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
bugsysservant-20091104-rit-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING

bugsysservant-20091105-mnz-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
bugsysservant-20091105-mnz-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
bugsysservant-20091105-mnz-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS

bugsysservant-20091105-mnz-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
bugsysservant-20091105-mnz-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL

camdixon-20130819-vpy-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
camdixon-20130819-vpy-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
camdixon-20130819-vpy-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
camdixon-20130819-vpy-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL

camdixon-20130819-vwy-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
camdixon-20130819-wve-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW

camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
camdixon-20130819-xdf-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
camdixon-20130819-ypc-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
camdixon-20130819-ypc-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
camdixon-20130819-ypc-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
camdixon-20130819-ypc-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
camdixon-20130819-ypc-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
camdixon-20130819-ypc-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
camdixon-20130819-ypc-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE

camdixon-20130819-ypc-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
camdixon-20130819-yuv-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
camdixon-20130828-crl-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
camdixon-20130910-jqj-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
camdixon-20141207-abe-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
camdixon-20141207-ajo-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
camdixon-20141207-anc-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
camdixon-20141207-apj-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
camdixon-20141207-aui-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
camdixon-20141207-bbs-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
camdixon-20141207-bbv-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
camdixon-20141207-bbv-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
camdixon-20141207-bfn-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0329 AH INDEED
camdixon-20141207-bic-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
camdixon-20141207-bnr-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
camdixon-20141207-bra-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
camdixon-20141207-byu-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
camdixon-20141207-ckc-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
camdixon-20141207-cun-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
camdixon-20141207-dbf-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
camdixon-20141207-dei-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
camdixon-20141207-dhp-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
camdixon-20141207-diw-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
camdixon-20141207-dom-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
camdixon-20141207-drv-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
camdixon-20141207-dvx-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
camdixon-20141207-dvz-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
camdixon-20141207-ebx-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
camdixon-20141207-els-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
camdixon-20141207-els-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
camdixon-20141207-els-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
camdixon-20141207-els-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
camdixon-20141207-els-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
camdixon-20141207-els-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
camdixon-20141207-els-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
camdixon-20141207-els-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
camdixon-20141207-els-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
camdixon-20141207-els-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
camdixon-20141207-ezi-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
camdixon-20141207-fdb-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
camdixon-20141207-fkk-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
camdixon-20141207-fuk-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
camdixon-20141207-fun-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
camdixon-20141207-fvp-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
camdixon-20141207-gcv-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
camdixon-20141207-hay-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
camdixon-20141207-ifn-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
camdixon-20141207-ifn-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
camdixon-20141207-ifn-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD

camdixon-20141207-kkp-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
camdixon-20141207-kkp-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
camdixon-20141207-kkp-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
camdixon-20141207-kkp-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
camdixon-20141207-kkp-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
camdixon-20141207-kkp-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
camdixon-20141207-kkp-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
camdixon-20141207-klc-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
camdixon-20141207-klq-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
camdixon-20141207-kwn-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
camdixon-20141207-kwn-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
camdixon-20141207-kwn-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
camdixon-20141207-kwn-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
camdixon-20141207-kwn-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
camdixon-20141207-kwn-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
camdixon-20141207-kwn-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
camdixon-20141207-kww-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
camdixon-20141207-kzg-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
camdixon-20141207-lar-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
camdixon-20141207-lpr-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
camdixon-20141207-ltg-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
camdixon-20141207-lti-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
camdixon-20141207-mjc-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
camdixon-20141207-muu-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
camdixon-20141207-ngg-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
camdixon-20141207-njt-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
camdixon-20141207-nla-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
camdixon-20141207-nmw-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
camdixon-20141207-npl-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
camdixon-20141207-nwl-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
camdixon-20141207-nxf-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
camdixon-20141207-odo-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
camdixon-20141207-ogo-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
camdixon-20141207-oon-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
camdixon-20141207-ooo-a0536 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
camdixon-20141207-ozt-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
camdixon-20141207-pak-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
camdixon-20141207-pdh-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
camdixon-20141207-piy-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
camdixon-20141207-qqp-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
camdixon-20141207-qsq-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
camdixon-20141207-qvw-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
camdixon-20141207-rmt-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
camdixon-20141207-sof-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
camdixon-20141207-twf-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
camdixon-20141207-uno-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
camdixon-20141207-uqq-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
camdixon-20141207-uqq-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
camdixon-20141207-uqq-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
camdixon-20141207-uqq-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
camdixon-20141207-uqq-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
camdixon-20141207-uqq-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
camdixon-20141207-uqq-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
camdixon-20141207-uqq-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
camdixon-20141207-uqq-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
camdixon-20141207-uqq-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
camdixon-20141207-wnj-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
camdixon-20141207-wsg-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
camdixon-20141207-xfg-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0152 PHILIP THRUST AGAINST HIM AND ENTERED
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
camdixon-20141207-xql-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
camdixon-20141207-ydv-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIENDS I SUBMIT MYSELF
camdixon-20141207-yzo-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
camdixon-20141207-zmk-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
camdixon-20141207-zvy-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
ccrawford-20100709-syq-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT

chocoholic-20070524-eti0023 A FRUMPY PARTY IS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN A COLLECTION OF BADLY DRESSED PERSONS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0024 PEOPLE WITH ALL THE BRAINS EVEN ALL THE BEAUTY IMAGINABLE MAKE AN ASSEMBLAGE OF DOWDS UNLESS THEY ARE WELL DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0025 NOT EVEN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BALLROOM IN THE WORLD
chocoholic-20070524-eti0026 DECORATED LIKE THE GARDEN OF EDEN
chocoholic-20070524-eti0027 COULD IN ITSELF SUGGEST A BRILLIANT ENTERTAINMENT IF THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO FILLED IT WERE FRUMPS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0028 OR WORSE YET VULGARIANS RATHER BE FRUMPY THAN VULGAR MUCH
chocoholic-20070524-eti0029 FRUMPS ARE OFTEN CELEBRITIES IN DISGUISE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0030 BUT A PERSON OF VULGAR APPEARANCE IS VULGAR ALL THROUGH
chocoholic-20070524-eti0031 THE SHEEP FRUMPS ARE NOT VERY TYPICAL OF AMERICA
chocoholic-20070524-eti0032 VULGARIANS ARE SOMEWHAT MORE NUMEROUS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0033 BUT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ALL ARE THE QUIETLY DRESSED UNNOTICEABLE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THE REPRESENTATIVE BACKBONE IN EVERY CITY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0034 WHO BUY GOOD CLOTHES BUT NOT MORE THAN THEY NEED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0035 AND WHOSE AMBITION IS MERELY TO BE WELL ENOUGH DRESSED TO FIT IN WITH THEIR BACKGROUND
chocoholic-20070524-eti0036 WHATEVER THEIR BACKGROUND MAY BE LESS NUMEROUS BUT FAR MORE CONSPICUOUS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0037 ARE THE DRESSED TO THE MINUTE WOMEN WHO
chocoholic-20070524-eti0038 LIKE SHEEP EXACTLY FOLLOW EVERY TURN OF LATEST FASHION BLINDLY AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SENSE OF DISTANCE OR DIRECTION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0039 AS EACH NEW SEASON'S FASHION IS DEFINED ALL THE SHEEP RUN AND DRESS THEMSELVES EACH IN A REPLICA OF THE OTHER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0040 THEIR OWN TYPES AND PERSONALITIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0041 FASHION SAYS WEAR BOLSTER CASES TIED AT THE NECK AND ANKLE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0042 OR A FEW WISPS OF GAUZE HELD IN PLACE WITH COURT PLASTER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0043 AND DAUGHTER MOTHER GRANDMOTHER AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS WEAR THE SAME
chocoholic-20070524-eti0044 IF EMERALD GREEN IS THE FASHIONABLE COLOR ALL OF THE YELLOWEST SKINS WILL BE FRAMED IN IT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0045 WHEN HOBBLE SKIRTS ARE THE THING THE FATTEST WABBLE ALONG LOOKING FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE CHANDELIERS TIED UP IN MOSQUITO NETTING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0046 IF BALL DRESSES ARE CUT TO THE LAST LIMIT OF DARING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0047 THE AMPLE BILLOWS OF THE FAT WILL VIE BLANDLY WITH THE MARVELS OF ANATOMY EXHIBITED BY THE THIN
chocoholic-20070524-eti0048 COMFORT CONVENIENCE BECOMINGNESS ADAPTABILITY BEAUTY ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0049 FASHION IS FOLLOWED TO THE LETTER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0050 THEREFORE THEY FANCY POOR SHEEP THEY ARE THE LAST WORD IN SMARTNESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0051 THOSE WHOM THE FASHION SUITS ARE SMART
chocoholic-20070524-eti0052 BUT THEY ARE SELDOM IF EVER DISTINGUISHED BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL PRECISELY ALIKE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0053 THE WOMAN WHO IS REALLY CHIC
chocoholic-20070524-eti0054 THE WOMAN WHO IS CHIC IS ALWAYS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0055 NOT DIFFERENT IN BEING BEHIND FASHION BUT ALWAYS SLIGHTLY APART FROM IT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0056 CHIC IS A BORROWED ADJECTIVE BUT THERE IS NO ENGLISH WORD TO TAKE THE PLACE OF ELEGANT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0057 WHICH WAS DESTROYED UTTERLY BY THE REPORTER OR PRACTICAL JOKER WHO SAID ELEGANT DRESSES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0058 AND YET THERE IS NO SYNONYM THAT WILL EXPRESS THE INDIVIDUALITY OF BEAUTIFUL TASTE COMBINED WITH PERSONAL DIGNITY AND GRACE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0059 WHICH GIVES TO A PERFECT COSTUME AN INIMITABLE AIR OF DISTINCTION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0060 UNE DAME ELEGANTE IS ALL OF THAT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0061 AND MRS OLDNAME IS JUST SUCH A PERSON
chocoholic-20070524-eti0062 SHE FOLLOWS FASHION MERELY SO FAR AS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0063 SHE GETS THE LATEST MODEL PERHAPS BUT HAS IT ADAPTED TO HER OWN TYPE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0064 SO THAT SHE HAS JUST THAT DISTINCTION OF APPEARANCE THAT THE SHEEP LACK
chocoholic-20070524-eti0065 SHE HAS EVEN CLUNG WITH SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS TO THE WORTH BALL DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0066 AND HER WRAPPED OR FITTED BODICE HAS CONTINUED TO LOOK THE SMARTEST IN EVERY BALLROOM
chocoholic-20070524-eti0067 IN SPITE OF THE GREEK DRAPERY AND ONE PIECE MEAL BAG AND ALL THE OTHER KALEIDOSCOPIC CHANGES OF FASHION THE REST OF US HAVE BEEN THROUGH
chocoholic-20070524-eti0068 BUT THE AVERAGE WOULD BE INDEPENDENT WHO DETERMINES TO STAND HER GROUND SAYING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0069 THESE NEW MODELS ARE PREPOSTEROUS I SHALL WEAR NOTHING OF THE SORT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0070 AND KEEPS HER WORD
chocoholic-20070524-eti0071 SOON FINDS HERSELF NOT AT ALL AN EXAMPLE OF DIGNITY BUT AN OBJECT OF DERISION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0072 FASHION HAS LITTLE IN COMMON WITH BEAUTY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0073 FASHION OUGHT TO BE LIKENED TO A TIDE OR EPIDEMIC
chocoholic-20070524-eti0074 SOMETIMES ONE MIGHT DEFINE IT AS A SORT OF HYPNOTISM SEEMINGLY EXERTED BY THE GODS AS A JOKE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0075 FASHION HAS THE POWER TO APPEAR TEMPORARILY IN THE GUISE OF BEAUTY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0076 THOUGH IT IS THE ANTITHESIS OF BEAUTY NEARLY ALWAYS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0077 IF YOU DOUBT IT LOOK AT OLD FASHION PLATES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0078 EVEN THE WOMAN OF BEAUTIFUL TASTE SUCCUMBS OCCASIONALLY TO THE EPIDEMICS OF FASHION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0079 BUT SHE IS MORE IMMUNE THAN MOST
chocoholic-20070524-eti0080 ALL WOMEN WHO HAVE ANY CLOTHES SENSE WHATEVER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0081 KNOW MORE OR LESS THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT ARE THEIR STYLE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0082 UNLESS THEY HAVE SUCH AN ATTACK OF FASHIONITIS AS TO BE IRRESPONSIBLY DELIRIOUS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0083 TO DESCRIBE ANY DETAILS OF DRESS THAT WILL NOT BE AS QUEER TO MORROW AS TO DAY'S FASHIONS ARE BOUND TO BE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0084 WOULD SEEM AT THE OUTSET PRETTY MUCH LIKE WRITING ABOUT NEXT YEAR'S WEATHER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0085 AND YET THERE IS ONE UNCHANGING PRINCIPLE WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED BY EVERY WOMAN MAN AND CHILD THAT IS WELL DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0086 SUITABILITY NOR DOES SUITABILITY MEAN MERELY THAT YOU MUST CHOOSE CLOTHES SUITABLE TO YOUR AGE AND APPEARANCE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0087 AND THAT YOU MUST GET A BALL DRESS FOR A BALL AND A STREET DRESS TO WALK IN
chocoholic-20070524-eti0088 IT MEANS EQUALLY THAT YOU MUST NOT BUY CLOTHES OUT OF PROPORTION TO YOUR INCOME OR OUT OF KEEPING WITH YOUR SURROUNDINGS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0089 DISPROPORTIONATE EXPENDITURE IN BAD TASTE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0090 ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE EXTRAVAGANCE IN WOMEN'S DRESS REACHED SUCH A HIGH WATER MARK THAT IT WAS NOT UNHEARD OF FOR A NEW YORK WOMAN TO SPEND A THIRD OF HER HUSBAND'S INCOME ON CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0091 ALL WOMEN OF FASHION BOUGHT CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0092 WHEN IT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO THEM TO BUY FURNITURE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0093 WHEN IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED PREPOSTEROUS TO BUY A PIECE OF JEWELRY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0094 BUT CLOTHES CLOTHES AND MORE CLOTHES EACH MORE HAND EMBROIDERED THAN THE LAST
chocoholic-20070524-eti0095 UNTIL JUST AS IT SEEMED THAT NO DRESS WAS FIT TO BE SEEN IF IT HADN'T A MONTH OR TWO OF SOME ONE'S TIME EMBROIDERED ON IT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0096 THE WORK ON CLOTHES SUBSIDED UNTIL NOW WE ARE AT THE OTHER EXTREME
chocoholic-20070524-eti0097 NO WORK IS PUT ON THEM AT ALL
chocoholic-20070524-eti0098 AT LEAST CLOTHES TO DAY ARE MUCH MORE SENSIBLE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0099 AND LET US HOPE THE SENSE WILL BE LASTING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0100 THE WAR DID AT LEAST MAKE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT LUXURIES AND TRIMMINGS COULD GO TOO FAR
chocoholic-20070524-eti0101 TEN YEARS AGO THE AMERICAN WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A LITTLE COTTAGE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0102 WHO WALKED WHEN SHE WENT OUT OR TOOK THE STREET CAR
chocoholic-20070524-eti0103 WORE THE SAME CLOTHES EXACTLY THAT MRS GILDING WORE IN HER VICTORIA
chocoholic-20070524-eti0104 OR TRAILED OVER A MING RUG THE FRENCH WOMAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND
chocoholic-20070524-eti0105 THE AMERICAN WOMAN OF TASTE IS NOW
chocoholic-20070524-eti0106 TOO GREAT AN ARTIST TO SIT IN A LITTLE ROOM WITH ITS COTTON PRINT SLIP COVERS MUSLIN CURTAINS AND GERANIUM POTS ON THE WINDOW LEDGE IN
chocoholic-20070524-eti0107 ANYTHING STRIKINGLY ELABORATE AND EXPENSIVE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0108 CHARMING AS HER DRESS MAY BE IN LINE AND CUT AND COLOR
chocoholic-20070524-eti0109 SHE KEEPS IT NO MATTER HOW INTRINSICALLY GOOD IT MAY BE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0110 IN HARMONY WITH HER GERANIUM POTS AND HER CHINTZ
chocoholic-20070524-eti0111 ON THE OTHER HAND CLOTHES THAT ARE TOO PLAIN CAN BE EQUALLY OUT OF PROPORTION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0112 LAST WINTER FOR INSTANCE A COMMITTEE OF LADIES MET IN WHAT MIGHT SAFELY BE CALLED THE HANDSOMEST HOUSE IN NEW YORK
chocoholic-20070524-eti0113 IN A ROOM THAT WOULD FIT PERFECTLY IN THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0114 FILLED WITH TREASURES SUCH AS THOSE OF THE WALLACE COLLECTION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0115 THE HOSTESS PRESIDED IN A BLACK SERGE GOLF SKIRT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0116 A BUSINESS WOMAN'S WHITE SHIRT WAIST AND STOUT WALKING BOOTS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0117 HER HAIR BRUSHED FLAT AND TIDILY BACK AND FASTENED AS THOUGH FOR RIDING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0118 HER FACE AND HANDS REDOLENT OF SOAP NO POWDER NOT A NAIL MANICURED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0119 HAD SHE BEEN A GIRL EARNING HER LIVING SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE SUITABLY DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0120 BUT HER MILLIONS AND HER PALACE BACKGROUND DEMAND THAT HER CLOTHES BE AT LEAST MODERATELY IN KEEPING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0121 ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DOWDY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BEING TOO RICHLY DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0122 AND TO DEFINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CLOTHES THAT ARE NOTABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR DISTINCTION AND SMARTNESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0123 AND CLOTHES THAT ARE MERELY CONSPICUOUS AND THEREFORE VULGAR
chocoholic-20070524-eti0124 IS A VERY ELUSIVE POINT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0125 HOWEVER THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES THAT SEEM PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0126 VULGAR CLOTHES VULGAR CLOTHES ARE THOSE WHICH NO MATTER WHAT THE FASHION OF THE MOMENT MAY BE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0127 ARE ALWAYS TOO ELABORATE FOR THE OCCASION TOO EXAGGERATED IN STYLE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0128 OR HAVE ACCESSORIES OUT OF PROPORTION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0129 PEOPLE OF UNCULTIVATED TASTE ARE APT TO FANCY DISTORTIONS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0130 TO EXAGGERATE RATHER THAN MODIFY THE PREVAILING FASHIONS FOR EXAMPLE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0131 A CONSPICUOUS EVIDENCE OF BAD STYLE THAT HAS PERSISTED THROUGH NUMBERLESS CHANGES IN FASHION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0132 IS THE OVER DRESSED AND OVER TRIMMED HEAD
chocoholic-20070524-eti0133 THE WOMAN OF UNCULTIVATED TASTE HAS NO MORE SENSE OF MODERATION THAN THE QUEEN OF THE CANNIBALS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0134 SHE WILL ELABORATE HER HAIR DRESSING TO START WITH
chocoholic-20070524-eti0135 THIS IS ALL RIGHT IF ELABORATION REALLY SUITS HER TYPE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0136 AND THEN SHE WILL DECORATE IT WITH EVERYTHING IN THE WAY OF MILLINERY AND JEWELRY THAT SHE CAN LAY HER HANDS ON
chocoholic-20070524-eti0137 OR IN THE DAYTIME SHE FANCIES EQUALLY OVER WEIGHTED HATS AND RICH LOOKING FUR COATS AND THE LATEST EDITION IN THE MOST CONSPICUOUS POSSIBLE FOOTWEAR
chocoholic-20070524-eti0138 AND SHE MUCH PREFERS WEARING RINGS TO GLOVES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0139 MAYBE SHE THINKS THEY DO NOT GO TOGETHER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0140 SHE DESPISES SENSIBLE CLOTHING SHE ALSO DESPISES PLAIN FABRICS AND UNTRIMMED MODELS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0141 SHE ALSO CARES LITTLE APPARENTLY FOR STAYING AT HOME SINCE SHE IS PERPETUALLY SEEN AT RESTAURANTS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0142 AND AT EVERY PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT THE FOOD SHE ORDERS IS RICH
chocoholic-20070524-eti0143 THE APPEARANCE SHE MAKES IS RICH
chocoholic-20070524-eti0144 IN FACT TO SEE HER OFTEN IS LIKE NOTHING SO MUCH AS BEING FORCED TO EAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF BUTTER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0145 PLAIN BEAU BRUMMEL'S REMARK THAT WHEN ONE ATTRACTED TOO MUCH NOTICE ONE COULD BE SURE OF BEING NOT WELL DRESSED BUT OVER DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0146 HAS FOR A HUNDRED YEARS BEEN THE COMFORT OF THE DOWDY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0147 IT IS OF COURSE VERY OFTEN TRUE BUT NOT INVARIABLY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0148 A PERSON MAY BE STARED AT FOR ANY ONE OF MANY REASONS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0149 IT DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON THE STARE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0150 A WOMAN MAY BE STARED AT BECAUSE SHE IS INDISCREET
chocoholic-20070524-eti0151 OR BECAUSE SHE LOOKS LIKE A LEFT OVER MEMBER OF THE CIRCUS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0152 OR BECAUSE SHE IS ENCHANTING TO LOOK AT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0153 IF YOU ARE MUCH STARED AT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0154 WHAT SORT OF A STARE DO YOU USUALLY MEET
chocoholic-20070524-eti0155 IS IT BOLD OR MOCKING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0156 OR IS IT MERELY THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU WISTFULLY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0157 IF THE FIRST CHANGE YOUR MANNER IF THE SECOND WEAR MORE CONVENTIONAL CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0158 IF THE THIRD YOU MAY BE LEFT AS YOU ARE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0159 BUT BE SURE OF YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF THIS LAST
chocoholic-20070524-eti0160 EXTRAVAGANCE NOT VULGARITY OSTENTATION IS ALWAYS VULGAR
chocoholic-20070524-eti0161 BUT EXTRAVAGANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY VULGAR NOT BY ANY MEANS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0162 EXTRAVAGANCE CAN BECOME DISHONEST IF CARRIED BEYOND ONE'S INCOME
chocoholic-20070524-eti0163 NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT IS BEAUTIFUL OR VALUABLE IS AN EXTRAVAGANCE FOR MOST OF US
chocoholic-20070524-eti0164 ALWAYS TO WEAR NEW GLOVES IS AN EXTRAVAGANT ITEM FOR ONE WITH A SMALL ALLOWANCE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0165 BUT SCARCELY VULGAR A LAUNDRY BILL CAN BE EXTRAVAGANT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0166 FLOWERS IN ONE'S CITY HOUSE A PIECE OF BEAUTIFUL FURNITURE A GOOD TAPESTRY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0167 EACH IS AN EXTRAVAGANCE TO AN INCOME THAT CAN NOT EASILY AFFORD THE EXPENDITURE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0168 TO ONE SUFFICIENT TO BUY THE TAPESTRY THE FLOWERS ARE NOT AN EXTRAVAGANCE AT ALL
chocoholic-20070524-eti0169 TO BUY QUANTITIES OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT EVEN USED AFTER THEY ARE BOUGHT IS SHEER WASTEFULNESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0170 AND TO BUY EVERYTHING THAT TEMPTS YOU WHETHER YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT OR NOT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0171 IS IF YOU CAN NOT AFFORD IT VERGING ON THE ACTUALLY DISHONEST
chocoholic-20070524-eti0172 DRESSES FOR DINNERS AND BALLS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0173 SUPPOSING SINCE CLOTHES SUITABLE TO THE OCCASION ARE THE FIRST REQUISITE OF GOOD TASTE WE TAKE UP A FEW DETAILS THAT ARE APART FROM FASHION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0174 A DINNER DRESS REALLY MEANS EVERY SORT OF LOW OR HALF LOW EVENING DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0175 A FORMAL DINNER DRESS LIKE A BALL DRESS IS ALWAYS LOW NECKED AND WITHOUT SLEEVES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0176 AND IS THE HANDSOMEST TYPE OF EVENING DRESS THAT THERE IS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0177 A BALL DRESS MAY BE EXQUISITE IN DETAIL BUT IT IS OFTEN MERELY EFFECTIVE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0178 THE PERFECT BALL DRESS IS ONE PURPOSELY DESIGNED WITH A SKIRT THAT IS BECOMING WHEN DANCING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0179 A LONG WRAPPED TYPE OF DRESS WOULD MAKE DIANA HERSELF LOOK LIKE A TOY MONKEY ON A STICK
chocoholic-20070524-eti0180 BUT MIGHT BE DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL AT A DINNER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0181 A DINNER DRESS DIFFERS FROM A BALL DRESS IN LITTLE EXCEPT THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY DESIGNED FOR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0182 HAIR ORNAMENTS ALWAYS LOOK WELL AT A BALL BUT ARE NOT ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE UNLESS UNIVERSALLY IN FASHION ON OTHER OCCASIONS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0183 A LADY IN A BALL DRESS WITH NOTHING ADDED TO THE HEAD
chocoholic-20070524-eti0184 LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE BEING HATLESS IN THE STREET
chocoholic-20070524-eti0185 THIS SOUNDS LIKE A CONTRADICTION OF THE CRITICISM OF THE VULGARIAN
chocoholic-20070524-eti0186 BUT BECAUSE A TIARA IS BEAUTIFUL AT A BALL OR A SPRAY OF FEATHERS OR A HIGH COMB OR ANOTHER ORNAMENT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0187 DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL OF THESE SHOULD BE PUT ON TOGETHER AND WORN IN A RESTAURANT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0188 WHICH IS JUST WHAT THE VULGARIAN WOULD DO
chocoholic-20070524-eti0189 WHETHER TO WEAR A HEAD DRESS HOWEVER DEPENDS NOT ALONE UPON FASHION
chocoholic-20070524-eti0190 BUT UPON THE INDIVIDUAL
chocoholic-20070524-eti0191 IF THE TYPE OF HAIR ORNAMENT AT THE MOMENT IN FASHION IS BECOMING WEAR IT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0192 ESPECIALLY TO BALLS AND IN A BOX AT THE OPERA
chocoholic-20070524-eti0193 BUT IF IT IS NOT BECOMING DON'T
chocoholic-20070524-eti0194 LADIES OF FASHION BY THE WAY DO NOT HAVE THEIR HAIR ESPECIALLY DRESSED FOR FORMAL OCCASIONS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0195 EACH WEARS HER HAIR A CERTAIN WAY AND IT IS PUT UP EVERY MORNING JUST AS CAREFULLY AS FOR A BALL
chocoholic-20070524-eti0196 THE ONLY TIME IT IS ARRANGED DIFFERENTLY IS FOR RIDING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0197 AH INFORMAL DINNER DRESS IS MERELY A MODIFIED FORMAL ONE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0198 IT IS LOW IN FRONT AND HIGH IN THE BACK
chocoholic-20070524-eti0199 WITH LONG OR ELBOW SLEEVES OR PERHAPS IT IS DUTCH NECK AND NO SLEEVES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0200 WHEN TRAINS ARE IN FASHION ALL OLDER WOMEN SHOULD WEAR THEM
chocoholic-20070524-eti0201 FASHION OR NO FASHION NO WOMAN WHO HAS PASSED FORTY LOOKS REALLY WELL IN A CUT OFF EVENING DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0202 AN EFFECT OF TRAIN HOWEVER CAN VERY ADEQUATELY BE PRODUCED WITH ANY ARRANGEMENT OR TRIMMING THAT EXTENDS UPON THE FLOOR
chocoholic-20070524-eti0203 THE INFORMAL DINNER DRESS IS WORN TO THE THEATER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0204 THE RESTAURANT OF HIGH CLASS THE CONCERT AND THE OPERA
chocoholic-20070524-eti0205 INFORMAL DINNER DRESSES ARE WORN IN THE BOXES AT THE OPERA ON ORDINARY NIGHTS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0206 SUCH AS WHEN NO ESPECIALLY GREAT STAR IS TO SING
chocoholic-20070524-eti0207 AND WHEN ONE IS NOT GOING ON TO A BALL AFTERWARD
chocoholic-20070524-eti0208 BUT A BALL DRESS IS NEVER INAPPROPRIATE ESPECIALLY WITHOUT HEAD DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0209 ON GALA NIGHTS BALL DRESSES ARE WORN IN THE BOXES AND HEAD DRESSES AND AS MANY JEWELS AS ONE CHOOSES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0210 OR HAS THE TEA GOWN
chocoholic-20070524-eti0211 EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT A TEA GOWN IS A HYBRID BETWEEN A WRAPPER AND A BALL DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0212 IT HAS ALWAYS A TRAIN AND USUALLY LONG FLOWING SLEEVES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0213 IS MADE OF RATHER GORGEOUS MATERIALS AND GOES ON EASILY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0214 AND ITS CHIEF USE IS NOT FOR WEAR AT THE TEA TABLE SO MUCH AS FOR DINNER ALONE WITH ONE'S FAMILY
chocoholic-20070524-eti0215 IT CAN HOWEVER VERY PROPERLY BE PUT ON FOR TEA
chocoholic-20070524-eti0216 AND IF ONE IS DINING AT HOME KEPT ON FOR DINNER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0217 OTHERWISE A LADY IS APT TO TAKE TEA IN WHATEVER DRESS SHE HAD ON FOR LUNCHEON
chocoholic-20070524-eti0218 AND DRESS AFTER TEA FOR DINNER
chocoholic-20070524-eti0219 ONE DOES NOT GO OUT TO DINE IN A TEA GOWN EXCEPT IN THE HOUSE OF A MEMBER OF ONE'S FAMILY OR A MOST INTIMATE FRIEND
chocoholic-20070524-eti0220 ONE WOULD WEAR A TEA GOWN IN ONE'S OWN HOUSE IN RECEIVING A GUEST TO WHOSE HOUSE ONE WOULD WEAR A DINNER DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0221 WHEN IN DOUBT THERE IS ONE RULE THAT IS FAIRLY SAFE TO FOLLOW
chocoholic-20070524-eti0222 WHEN IN DOUBT WEAR THE PLAINER DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0223 IT IS ALWAYS BETTER FAR TO BE UNDER DRESSED THAN OVER DRESSED
chocoholic-20070524-eti0224 IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO PUT ON A BALL DRESS OR A DINNER DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0225 WEAR THE DINNER DRESS OR WHETHER TO WEAR CLOTH OR BROCADE TO A LUNCHEON
chocoholic-20070524-eti0226 WEAR THE CLOTH ON THE STREET
chocoholic-20070524-eti0227 YOUR TEA GOWNS SINCE THEY ARE NEVER WORN IN PUBLIC
chocoholic-20070524-eti0228 CAN LITERALLY BE AS BIZARRE AS YOU PLEASE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0229 AND IF YOU ARE DRIVING IN A CLOSED MOTOR YOU CAN ALSO WEAR AN ORIGINAL TYPE OF DRESS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0230 BUT IN WALKING ON THE STREET
chocoholic-20070524-eti0231 IF YOU CARE TO BE TAKEN FOR A WELL BRED PERSON
chocoholic-20070524-eti0232 NEVER WEAR ANYTHING THAT IS EXAGGERATED IF SKIRTS ARE SHORT
chocoholic-20070524-eti0233 DON'T WEAR THEM TWO INCHES SHORTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE'S
chocoholic-20070524-eti0234 IF THEY ARE LONG DON'T GO DOWN THE STREET DRAGGING A TRAIN AND SWEEPING THE DIRT UP ON THE UNDER FLOUNCINGS
chocoholic-20070524-eti0235 LET US HOPE THAT FASHION NEVER COMES BACK
chocoholic-20070524-eti0236 DON'T WEAR TOO MUCH JEWELRY IT IS IN BAD TASTE IN THE FIRST PLACE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0237 AND IN THE SECOND IS A TEMPTATION TO A THIEF
chocoholic-20070524-eti0238 AND DON'T UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DISTORT YOUR FIGURE INTO A GROTESQUE SHAPE
chocoholic-20070524-eti0239 COUNTRY CLOTHES NOTHING SO MARKS THE PERSON WHO DOESN'T KNOW AS INAPPROPRIATE CHOICE OF CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0240 TO WEAR ELABORATE CLOTHES OUT OF DOORS IN THE COUNTRY IS QUITE AS OUT OF PLACE AS TO PARADE SPORTS CLOTHES ON THE STREETS IN TOWN
chocoholic-20070524-eti0241 IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT SPORT CLOTHES ARE APPROPRIATE COUNTRY CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0242 ESPECIALLY FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE ELDERLY LADIES NEEDLESS TO SAY SHOULD NOT DON SPORTING ECCENTRICITIES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0243 NOR WEAR SWEATERS TO LUNCH PARTIES
chocoholic-20070524-eti0244 BUT SENSIBLE COUNTRY CLOTHES SUCH AS HAVE FOR MANY DECADES BEEN WORN IN ENGLAND
chocoholic-20070524-eti0245 OF HOMESPUN OR SERGE OR JERSEY CLOTH OR WHATEVER HAS REPLACED THESE MATERIALS

chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0145 ESPECIALLY AT PRESENT FIRST OF ALL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0146 TO MIND WEARING A DRESS MANY TIMES BECAUSE IT INDICATES A SMALL BANK ACCOUNT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0147 IS TO EXHIBIT A FALSE NOTION OF THE VALUES IN LIFE

chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0159 SHE WHO MUST WEAR ONE DRESS THROUGH A SEASON
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0160 AND HAVE IT PERHAPS MADE OVER THE NEXT WOULD BETTER CHOOSE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0161 BLACK OR CREAM COLOR OR PERHAPS A CERTAIN COLOR SUITS HER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0162 AND THIS FACT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR HER HABITUALLY TO WEAR IT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0163 WITHOUT IMPRESSING OTHERS WITH HER LACK OF CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0164 BUT WHETHER HER BACKGROUND BE BLACK OR CERISE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0165 IT SHOULD INVARIABLY BLEND WITH HER WHOLE WARDROBE

chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0171 WHICH RATHER WEAKENS THE ARGUMENT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0172 HOWEVER A BLUE FAN DOES NOT LOOK WELL WITH A PINK OR A GREEN DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0173 NOR DO THE OTHER COMBINATIONS SUPPOSING HOWEVER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0174 YOU HAD INSTEAD A CREAM COLORED DRESS A FLESH COLORED

chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0178 WITH ALL THREE SO IS A CREAM ONE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0179 OR PERHAPS BY CHANGING BOTH FAN AND SLIPPERS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0180 A DIFFERENT EFFECT IS PRODUCED SINCE THE COLORS OF YOUR CLOTHES ARE BACKGROUND COLORS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0181 BUT NOTHING REALLY CAN COMPARE WITH THE UTILITY AND SMARTNESS OF

chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0192 TULLE CAN BE CHANGED ALMOST AS EASILY AS THOUGH DONE WITH A MAGICIAN'S WAND
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0193 TO CHOOSE DAYTIME CLOTHES THAT GO WITH THE SAME HATS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0194 SHOES PARASOLS WRIST BAGS AND GLOVES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0195 A SNUFF COLORED DRESS AND A GRAY ONE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0196 NEED ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ACCESSORIES RUSSET SHOES CHAMOIS GLOVES AND SAND COLORED HAT

chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0200 CHOOSE THE CLOTHES WHICH YOU MUST HAVE CAREFULLY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0201 AND IF YOU MUST CUT DOWN CUT DOWN ON ELABORATE ONES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0202 THERE IS SCARCELY ANYWHERE THAT YOU CAN NOT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0203 FITTINGLY GO IN PLAIN CLOTHES VERY FEW IF ANY PEOPLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0204 NEED FANCY THINGS ALL PEOPLE NEED PLAIN ONES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0205 A VERY BEAUTIFUL CHICAGO WOMAN WHO IS ALWAYS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0206 PERFECTLY DRESSED FOR EVERY OCCASION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0207 WORKED OUT THE COST OF HER OWN CLOTHES THIS WAY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0208 ON A SHEET OF PAPER THUMB TACKED ON THE INSIDE OF HER CLOSET DOOR
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0209 SHE PUT A COMPLETE TYPEWRITTEN LIST OF HER DRESSES AND HATS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0210 AND THE COST OF EACH EVERY TIME SHE PUT ON A DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0211 SHE MADE A PENCIL MARK BY AND BY WHEN A DRESS WAS DISCARDED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0212 SHE DIVIDED THE COST OF IT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0213 BY THE NUMBER OF TIMES IT HAD BEEN WORN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0214 IN THIS WAY SHE FOUND OUT ACCURATELY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0215 WHICH WERE HER CHEAPEST AND WHICH HER MOST EXPENSIVE CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0216 WHEN GETTING NEW ONES SHE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0217 SINCE SHE AVOIDS THE DRESS THAT IS NEVER PUT ON
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0218 WHICH IS A BIGGER HANDICAP FOR THE MEDIUM SIZED ALLOWANCE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0219 THAN MANY WOMEN REALIZE WHAT TO WEAR IN A RESTAURANT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0220 RESTAURANT DRESS DEPENDS UPON THE RESTAURANT AND THE CITY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0221 BECAUSE WOMEN IN NEW YORK WEAR LOW NECKED DRESSES AND NO HATS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0222 DOES NOT MEAN THAT THOSE WHO LIVE IN NEW TOWN SHOULD DO THE SAME
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0223 IF IT IS NOT NEW TOWN'S CUSTOM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0224 BUT YOU MUST NEVER WEAR AN EVENING DRESS AND A HAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0225 AND NEVER WEAR A DAY DRESS WITHOUT ONE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0226 IF IN THE CITY WHERE YOU LIVE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0227 PEOPLE WEAR DAY CLOTHES IN THE EVENING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0228 YOU CAN ONLY VERY SLIGHTLY DIFFER FROM THEM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0229 IT IS NEVER GOOD FORM TO BE ELABORATELY DRESSED IN A PUBLIC
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0230 PLACE EXCEPT IN A BOX AT THE OPERA
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0231 OR AT A CHARITY BALL AT A WEDDING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0232 A GARDEN PARTY OR AFTERNOON TEA
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0233 THESE ARE THE OCCASIONS WHEN ELABORATE DAY DRESSES ARE APPROPRIATE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0234 BUT IF YOU HAVE VERY FEW CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0235 YOU CAN PERFECTLY WELL WEAR ANY SORT OF DAY DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0236 THAT MAY BE IN FASHION A COAT AND SKIRT IS NOT APPROPRIATE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0237 SINCE A SKIRT AND SHIRT WAIST IS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0238 AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN A UTILITY COMBINATION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0239 UNLESS OF COURSE THE WAIST IS OF A COLOR TO MATCH THE SKIRT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0240 SO THAT IT HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0241 YOU NEED HOWEVER SELDOM WORRY ABOUT YOUR APPEARANCE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT AS DRESSED AS THE OTHERS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0242 THE TIME TO WORRY IS WHEN YOU ARE MORE DRESSED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0243 THAN ANY ONE ELSE FOR A GARDEN PARTY A COUNTRY DRESS IS QUITE ALL RIGHT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0244 THOUGH IF YOU HAVE A VERY ELABORATE SUMMER DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0245 THIS IS THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN WEAR IT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0246 NO ONE HAS TO BE TOLD WHAT TO WEAR TO CHURCH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0247 IN SMALL COUNTRY CHURCHES AT THE SEASHORE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0248 PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH IN COUNTRY CLOTHES OTHERWISE AS EVERY ONE KNOWS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0249 ONE PUTS ON TOWN CLOTHES AND GLOVES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0250 AT A FORMAL LUNCHEON IN TOWN ONE SEES EVERY SORT OF DRESS FROM VELVET
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0251 TO TAILOR MADE CERTAIN LADIES OLDER ONES USUALLY WHO LIKE ELABORATE CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0252 WEAR THEM BUT YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE USUALLY DRESSED IN WORSTED MATERIALS OR SILKS THAT ARE DULL IN FINISH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0253 AND THAT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE EMBROIDERED AND VERY EXPENSIVE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0254 GIVE AN EFFECT OF SIMPLICITY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0255 ONE SHOULD ALWAYS WEAR A SIMPLER DRESS IN ONE'S OWN HOUSE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0256 THAN ONE WEARS IN GOING TO THE HOUSE OF ANOTHER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0257 A FEW GENERAL REMARKS THE FAULT OF
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0258 BAD TASTE IS USUALLY IN OVER DRESSING QUALITY NOT EFFECT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0259 IS THE STANDARD TO SEEK FOR MACHINE MADE PASSEMENTERIE ON TOP OF CONSPICUOUS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0260 BUT SLEAZY MATERIAL IS ALWAYS SHODDY CUT AND FIT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0261 ARE THE TWO ITEMS OF GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0262 AS WELL AS IN MEN'S BUT FASHION CHANGES TOO RAPIDLY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0263 TO MAKE VALUE OF MATERIAL ALWAYS WISE EXPENDITURE FOR ONE OF SLENDER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0264 PURSE BETTER USUALLY HAVE TWO DRESSES EACH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0265 CUT AND MADE IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0266 THAN ONE WHICH MUST BE WORN AFTER THE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0267 WHIM HAS BECOME A FREAK IN MEN'S CLOTHES THE OPPOSITE RULE SHOULD BE FOLLOWED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0268 SINCE GOOD STYLE IN MEN'S CLOTHES IS UNCHANGING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0269 TO BUY THINGS AT SALES IS VERY MUCH LIKE BUYING THINGS AT AN AUCTION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0270 IF YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND SOMETHING ABOUT VALUES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0271 YOU CAN OFTEN DO MARVELLOUSLY WELL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0272 BUT IF YOU ARE EASILY BEWILDERED AND KNOW LITTLE OF VALUES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0273 YOU ARE APT TO SPEND YOUR GOOD MONEY ON TRASH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0274 A WOMAN OF SMALL MEANS MUST EITHER BE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0275 OR LEARN TO BE DISCRIMINATINGLY CAREFUL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0276 OR SHE WOULD BETTER HAVE HER CLOTHES MADE AT HOME
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0277 OR IF SHE IS OF MODEL TYPE BUY THEM READY MADE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0278 THE READY TO WEAR CLOTHES IN THE MISSES DEPARTMENT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0279 ARE GROWING EVERY YEAR BETTER LOOKING UNFORTUNATELY AND FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0280 THE USUAL WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT DOES NOT COMPARE IN GOOD TASTE IN SELECTION OF MODELS WITH
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0281 THE FORMER AND IT IS UNUSUAL TO FIND A DRESS THAT A LADY OF FASHION WOULD CHOOSE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0282 EXCEPT AMONG THE IMPORTED MODELS FOR WHICH STORE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0283 PRICES ARE AS A RULE HIGHER THAN THOSE ASKED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0284 BY THE GREATEST DRESSMAKERS EVENING CLOTHES ARE STILL USUALLY UNBUYABLE BY THE OVER FASTIDIOUS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0285 EXCEPT FOR A CERTAIN FLAPPER TYPE AND AN UNDISTINGUISHED ONE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0286 AT THAT AND THE ULTRA SMART WOMAN IS STILL OBLIGED TO GO TO THE PRIVATE IMPORTERS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0287 FOR HER DEBUTANTE DAUGHTER'S BALL DRESSES AS WELL AS HER OWN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0288 OR ELSE INTO HER OWN SEWING ROOM FASHION AND FAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0289 FOR YEARS THE THIN EVEN THE SCRAWNY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0290 HAVE HAD EVERYTHING THEIR OWN WAY THE WOMAN WHO IS FAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0291 OR EVEN PLUMP HAS A RATHER HOPELESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0292 PROBLEM UNLESS FASHION GOES TO TURKEY FOR ITS NEXT INSPIRATION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0293 WHICH IS SO UNLIKELY IT IS ALMOST POSSIBLE TWO THINGS THE FAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0294 WOMAN SHOULD AVOID BIG PATTERNS AND THE STIFF TAILOR MADE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0295 FAT WOMEN LOOK BETTER IN FEMININE CLOTHES THAT FOLLOW IN THE WAKE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0296 NEVER IN THE ADVANCE OF MODIFIED FASHION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0297 FAT WOMEN SHOULD NEVER WEAR ELABORATE CLOTHES OR CLOTHES IN LIGHT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0298 COLORS OR HEAVILY FEATHERED HATS THE TENDENCY OF FAT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0299 IS TO TAKE AWAY FROM ONE'S GRACILITY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0300 THEREFORE ANY ONE INCLINED TO BE FAT MUST BE ULTRA CONSERVATIVE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0301 IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECT VERY TIGHT CLOTHES MAKE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0302 FAT PEOPLE LOOK FATTER AND THIN PEOPLE THINNER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0303 SATIN IS A BAD MATERIAL SINCE HIGH LIGHTS ARE TOO SHIMMERINGLY ACCENTUATED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0304 HEAVY ANKLES NEEDLESS TO SAY SHOULD NEVER BE CLOTHED IN LIGHT STOCKINGS AND DARK SHOES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0305 LONG POINTED SLIPPERS ACCENTUATE A THICK ANKLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0306 AND SO DOES A SHORT SKIRT THAT HAS A STRAIGHT HEM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0307 A RAGGED EDGE IS MOST FLATTERING DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0308 STOCKINGS AND SLIPPERS TO MATCH ARE UNAVOIDABLE IN EVENING DRESS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0309 BUT WHEN POSSIBLE A THICK ANKLE SHOULD HAVE A DARK STOCKING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0310 OR AT LEAST A SLIPPER TO MATCH THE STOCKING
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0311 PEOPLE SHOULD SELECT COLORS THAT GO WITH THEIR SKIN AND
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0312 ELDERLY WOMEN SHOULD NOT WEAR GRASS GREEN OR ROYAL BLUE OR PURPLE OR ANY HARD COLOR THAT NEEDS A FAULTLESS COMPLEXION
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0313 SWARTHY SKIN ALWAYS LOOKS BETTER IN COLORS THAT HAVE RED OR YELLOW IN THEM
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0314 A VERY SALLOW PERSON IN PALE BLUE OR APPLE GREEN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0315 LOOKS LIKE A WELL DEVELOPED CASE OF JAUNDICE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0316 PINK AND ORCHID ARE OFTEN VERY BECOMING TO OLDER WOMEN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0317 AND PALE BLUE OR YELLOW TO THOSE WITH FAIR SKIN
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0318 BECAUSE A WOMAN IS NO LONGER YOUNG IS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD WEAR PERPETUAL BLACK
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0319 UNLESS SHE IS FAT CLOTHES FOR TRAVELING IN EUROPE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0320 IDEAL TRAVELING CLOTHES ARE THOSE WHICH DO NOT WRINKLE OR SHOW RAIN SPOTS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0321 AND TO FIND WHICH THESE ARE IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A SAMPLE OF EACH MATERIAL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0322 SPRINKLE IT WITH WATER AND TWIST IT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0323 TO SEE HOW MUCH ABUSE IT WILL STAND
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0324 EVERY WOMAN KNOWS WHAT SHE LIKES BEST AND WHAT SHE CONSIDERS SUITABLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0325 TWO ALTERNATING TRAVELING DRESSES AT LEAST WILL BE NECESSARY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0326 AND TWO OR THREE SEMI EVENING DRESSES TO PUT ON
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0327 FOR DINNER ONE VERY SIMPLE HALF DINNER DRESS OF BLACK
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0328 THAT HAS A COMBINATION OF TRIMMINGS SUCH AS DESCRIBED EARLIER IN THIS CHAPTER
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0329 IS IDEALLY USEFUL TOURISTS DO NOT PUT ON EVENING CLOTHES EXCEPT IN VERY FASHIONABLE CENTERS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0330 SUCH AS LONDON PARIS MONTE CARLO OR DEAUVILLE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0331 AND THEN ONLY IF STAYING AT AN ULTRA FASHIONABLE HOTEL
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0332 TO BE OVER DRESSED IS ALWAYS IN BAD TASTE
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0333 SO THAT UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO VISIT
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0334 OR MAKE SEVERAL DAY STOPS THE ONE BLACK EVENING DRESS SUGGESTED
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0335 WOULD ANSWER EVERY POSSIBLE PURPOSE

chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0338 AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO VISIT IN ENGLAND
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0339 OR TO STAY ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY YOU WILL NEED COUNTRY CLOTHES
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0340 BUT NOT ON ORDINARY TOURING FOR MOTORING SPACE IS PRECIOUS
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0341 AND CLOTHES SHOULD BE CHOSEN WITH THE OBJECT OF
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0342 PACKING INTO SMALL DIMENSIONS MOTORING IN EUROPE IS COLD
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0343 A VERY WARM LONG WRAP IS NECESSARY
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0344 AN OLD FUR ONE IS MUCH THE BEST
chocoholic-20070612-eti33-eti0345 AND A SMALL CLOSE HAT THAT DOES NOT BLOW

chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0004 THE KINDERGARTEN OF ETIQUETTE IN THE HOUSES OF THE WELL TO DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0005 WHERE THE NURSERY IS IN CHARGE OF A WOMAN OF REFINEMENT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0006 WHO IS COMPETENT TO TEACH LITTLE CHILDREN PROPER BEHAVIOR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0007 THEY ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO COME TO TABLE IN THE DINING ROOM UNTIL THEY HAVE LEARNED AT LEAST THE ELEMENTS OF GOOD MANNERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0008 BUT WHETHER IN A BIG HOUSE OF THIS DESCRIPTION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0009 OR IN A SMALL HOUSE WHERE PERHAPS THE MOTHER ALONE MUST BE THE TEACHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0010 CHILDREN CAN SCARCELY BE TOO YOUNG TO BE TAUGHT THE RUDIMENTS OF ETIQUETTE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0011 NOR CAN THE TEACHING BE TOO PATIENTLY OR TOO CONSCIENTIOUSLY CARRIED OUT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0012 TRAINING A CHILD IS EXACTLY LIKE TRAINING A PUPPY A LITTLE HEEDLESS INATTENTION AND IT IS OUT IF HAND IMMEDIATELY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0013 THE GREAT THING IS NOT TO LET IT ACQUIRE BAD HABITS THAT MUST AFTERWARD BE BROKEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0014 ANY CHILD CAN BE TAUGHT TO BE BEAUTIFULLY BEHAVED WITH NO EFFORT GREATER THAN QUIET PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0015 WHEREAS TO BREAK BAD HABITS ONCE THEY ARE ACQUIRED IS A HERCULEAN TASK ELEMENTARY TABLE MANNERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0016 SINCE A VERY LITTLE CHILD CAN NOT HOLD A SPOON PROPERLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0017 AND AS NEATNESS IS THE FIRST REQUISITE IN TABLE MANNERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0018 IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HOLD ITS SPOON AS IT MIGHT TAKE HOLD OF A BAR IN FRONT OF IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0019 BACK OF THE HAND UP THUMB CLOSED OVER FIST THE PUSHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0020 A SMALL FLAT PIECE OF SILVER AT RIGHT ANGLES TO A HANDLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0021 IS HELD IN THE SAME WAY IN THE LEFT HAND ALSO IN THE FIRST EATING LESSONS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0022 A BABY MUST BE ALLOWED TO PUT A SPOON IN ITS MOUTH POINTED END FOREMOST
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0023 ITS FIRST LESSONS MUST BE TO TAKE SMALL MOUTHFULS TO EAT VERY SLOWLY TO SPILL NOTHING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0024 TO KEEP THE MOUTH SHUT WHILE CHEWING AND NOT SMEAR ITS FACE OVER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0025 IN DRINKING A CHILD SHOULD USE BOTH HANDS TO HOLD A MUG OR GLASS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0026 UNTIL ITS HAND IS BIG ENOUGH SO IT CAN EASILY HOLD A GLASS IN ONE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0027 WHEN IT CAN EAT WITHOUT SPILLING ANYTHING OR SMEARING ITS LIPS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0028 AND DRINK WITHOUT MAKING GREASE MOONS ON ITS MUG OR TUMBLER BY ALWAYS WIPING ITS MOUTH BEFORE DRINKING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0029 IT MAY BE ALLOWED TO COME TO TABLE IN THE DINING ROOM AS A TREAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0030 FOR SUNDAY LUNCH OR BREAKFAST OR IF IT HAS BEEN TAUGHT BY ITS MOTHER AT TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0031 SHE CAN RELAX HER ATTENTION SOMEWHAT FROM ITS PROGRESS GIRLS ARE USUALLY DAINTIER AND MORE EASILY TAUGHT THAN BOYS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0032 BUT MOST CHILDREN WILL BEHAVE BADLY AT TABLE IF LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0033 EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY COMMIT NO SERIOUS OFFENSES SUCH AS MAKING A MESS OF THEIR FOOD OR THEMSELVES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0034 OR TALKING WITH THEIR MOUTHS FULL ALL CHILDREN LOVE TO CRUMB BREAD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0035 FLOP THIS WAY AND THAT IN THEIR CHAIRS KNOCK SPOONS AND FORKS TOGETHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0036 DAWDLE OVER THEIR FOOD FEED ANIMALS IF ANY ARE ALLOWED IN THE ROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0037 OR BECOME RESTLESS AND NOISY ONCE GRADUATED TO THE DINING ROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0038 ANY REVERSION TO SUCH TACTICS MUST BE FIRMLY REPREHENDED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0039 AND THE CHILD SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT CONTINUED OFFENSE MEANS A RETURN TO THE NURSERY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0040 BUT BEFORE COMPANY IT IS BEST TO SAY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0041 SINCE TOO MUCH NAGGING IN THE PRESENCE OF STRANGERS LESSENS A CHILD'S INCENTIVE TO GOOD BEHAVIOR BEFORE THEM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0042 IF IT REFUSES TO BEHAVE NICELY MUCH THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO SAY NOTHING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0043 BUT GET UP AND QUIETLY LEAD IT FROM THE TABLE BACK TO THE NURSERY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0044 IT IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE CHILD BUT ANNOYING TO A GUEST
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0045 TO CONTINUE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE COMPANY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0046 AND THE CHILD LEARNS MUCH MORE QUICKLY TO BE WELL BEHAVED IF IT UNDERSTANDS THAT GOOD BEHAVIOR IS THE PRICE OF ADMISSION TO GROWN UP SOCIETY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0047 A WORD OR TWO SUCH AS DON'T LEAN ON THE TABLE DARLING OR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0048 PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING DEAR SHOULD SUFFICE BUT A CHILD THAT IS NOISY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0049 THAT REACHES OUT TO HELP ITSELF TO CANDY OR CAKE THAT INTERRUPTS THE CONVERSATION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0050 THAT EATS UNTIDILY HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE NURSERY BEFORE IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY GRADUATED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0051 TABLE MANNERS MUST OF COURSE PROCEED SLOWLY IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT ANY OTHER LESSONS PROCEED IN SCHOOL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0052 HAVING LEARNED WHEN A BABY TO USE THE NURSERY IMPLEMENTS OF SPOON AND PUSHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0053 THE CHILD WHEN IT IS A LITTLE OLDER DISCARDS THEM FOR THE FORK SPOON
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0054 AND KNIFE THE PROPER USE OF THE FORK AS SOON THEREFORE AS HIS HAND IS DEXTEROUS ENOUGH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0055 THE CHILD MUST BE TAUGHT TO HOLD HIS FORK NO LONGER GRIPPED BABY FASHION IN HIS FIST
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0056 BUT MUCH AS A PENCIL IS HELD IN WRITING ONLY THE FINGERS ARE PLACED NEARER THE TOP
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0057 THAN THE POINT THE THUMB AND TWO FIRST FINGERS ARE CLOSED AROUND THE HANDLE TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY UP THE SHANK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0058 AND THE FOOD IS TAKEN UP SHOVEL WISE ON THE TURNED UP PRONGS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0059 AT FIRST HIS LITTLE FINGERS WILL HOLD HIS FORK STIFFLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0060 BUT AS HE GROWS OLDER HIS FINGERS WILL BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0061 JUST AS THEY WILL IN HOLDING HIS PENCIL IF HE FINDS IT HARD WORK TO SHOVEL HIS FOOD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0062 HE CAN FOR A WHILE CONTINUE TO USE HIS NURSERY PUSHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0063 BY AND BY THE PUSHER IS CHANGED FOR A SMALL PIECE OF BREAD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0064 WHICH IS HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND AND BETWEEN THUMB AND FIRST TWO FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0065 AND AGAINST WHICH THE FORK SHOVELS UP SUCH ELUSIVE ARTICLES AS CORN PEAS POACHED EGG
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0066 ETC THE SPOON IN USING THE SPOON HE HOLDS IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND LIKE THE FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0067 IN EATING CEREAL OR DESSERT HE MAY BE ALLOWED TO DIP THE BOWL OF THE SPOON TOWARD HIM AND EAT FROM THE END
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0068 BUT IN EATING SOUP HE MUST DIP HIS SPOON AWAY FROM HIM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0069 TURNING THE OUTER RIM OF THE BOWL DOWN AS HE DOES SO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0070 FILL THE BOWL NOT MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS FULL AND SIP IT WITHOUT NOISE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0071 OUT OF THE SIDE NOT THE END OF THE BOWL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0072 THE REASON WHY THE BOWL MUST NOT BE FILLED FULL IS BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIFT A BRIMMING SPOONFUL OF LIQUID TO HIS MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0073 WITHOUT SPILLING SOME OR IN THE CASE OF PORRIDGE WITHOUT FILLING HIS MOUTH TOO FULL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0074 WHILE STILL VERY YOUNG HE MAY BE TAUGHT NEVER TO LEAVE THE SPOON IN A CUP
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0075 WHILE DRINKING OUT OF IT BUT AFTER STIRRING THE COCOA OR WHATEVER IT IS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0076 TO LAY THE SPOON IN THE SAUCER A VERY UGLY TABLE HABIT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0077 WHICH SEEMS TO BE AN IMPULSE AMONG ALL CHILDREN IS TO PILE A GREAT QUANTITY OF FOOD ON A FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0078 AND THEN LICK OR BITE IT OFF PIECEMEAL THIS MUST ON NO ACCOUNT BE PERMITTED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0079 IT IS PERFECTLY CORRECT HOWEVER TO SIP A LITTLE AT A TIME OF HOT LIQUID FROM A SPOON
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0080 IN TAKING ANY LIQUID EITHER FROM A SPOON OR DRINKING VESSEL NO NOISE MUST EVER BE MADE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0081 THE FORK AND KNIFE TOGETHER IN BEING TAUGHT TO USE HIS KNIFE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0082 THE CHILD SHOULD AT FIRST CUT ONLY SOMETHING VERY EASY SUCH AS A SLICE OF CHICKEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0083 HE SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT ANYTHING WITH BONES OR GRISTLE OR ANYTHING THAT IS TOUGH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0084 IN HIS LEFT HAND IS PUT HIS FORK WITH THE PRONGS DOWNWARD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0085 HELD NEAR THE TOP OF THE HANDLE HIS INDEX FINGER IS PLACED ON THE SHANK SO THAT IT POINTS TO THE PRONGS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0086 AND IS SUPPORTED AT THE SIDE BY HIS THUMB HIS OTHER FINGERS CLOSE UNDERNEATH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0087 AND HOLD THE HANDLE TIGHT HE MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HOLD HIS FORK EMIGRANT FASHION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0088 PERPENDICULARLY CLUTCHED IN THE CLENCHED FIST AND TO SAW ACROSS THE FOOD AT ITS BASE WITH HIS KNIFE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0089 THE KNIFE THE KNIFE IS HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND EXACTLY AS THE FORK IS HELD IN HIS LEFT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0090 FIRMLY AND AT THE END OF THE HANDLE WITH THE INDEX FINGER POINTING DOWN THE BACK OF THE BLADE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0091 IN CUTTING HE SHOULD LEARN NOT TO SCRAPE THE BACK OF THE FORK PRONGS WITH THE CUTTING EDGE OF THE KNIFE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0092 HAVING CUT OFF A MOUTHFUL HE THRUSTS THE FORK THROUGH IT WITH PRONGS POINTED DOWNWARD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0093 AND CONVEYS IT TO HIS MOUTH WITH HIS LEFT HAND
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0094 HE MUST LEARN TO CUT OFF AND EAT ONE MOUTHFUL AT A TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0095 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO ADD THAT THE KNIFE MUST NEVER BE PUT IN HIS MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0096 NOR IS IT GOOD FORM TO USE THE KNIFE UNNECESSARILY SOFT FOODS LIKE CROQUETTES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0097 HASH ON TOAST ALL EGGS AND VEGETABLES SHOULD BE CUT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0098 OR MERELY BROKEN APART WITH THE EDGE OF THE FORK HELD LIKE THE KNIFE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0099 AFTER WHICH THE FORK IS TURNED IN THE HAND TO FIRST OR SHOVEL POSITION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0100 THE KNIFE MUST NEVER BE USED TO SCOOP BAKED POTATO OUT OF THE SKIN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0101 OR TO BUTTER POTATO A FORK MUST BE USED FOR ALL MANIPULATIONS OF VEGETABLES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0102 BUTTER FOR BAKED POTATOES TAKEN ON THE TIP OF THE FORK SHOVEL FASHION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0103 LAID ON THE POTATO AND THEN PRESSED DOWN AND MIXED WITH THE PRONGS HELD POINTS CURVED UP
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0104 WHEN NO KNIFE IS BEING USED THE FORK IS HELD IN THE RIGHT HAND
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0105 WHETHER USED PRONGS DOWN TO IMPALE THE MEAT OR PRONGS UP TO LIFT VEGETABLES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0106 TO PILE MASHED POTATO AND OTHER VEGETABLES ON THE CONVEX SIDE OF THE FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0107 ON TOP OF THE MEAT FOR TWO OR MORE INCHES OF ITS LENGTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0108 IS A DISGUSTING HABIT DEAR TO SCHOOL BOYS AND ONE THAT IS MORE EASILY PREVENTED THAN CORRECTED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0109 IN FACT TAKING A BIG MOUTHFUL NEXT TO SMEARING HIS FACE AND CHEWING WITH MOUTH OPEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0110 IS THE WORST OFFENSE AT TABLE WHEN HE HAS FINISHED EATING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0111 HE SHOULD LAY HIS KNIFE AND FORK CLOSE TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0112 WITH HANDLES TOWARD THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0113 THE HANDLES PROJECTING AN INCH OR TWO BEYOND THE RIM OF THE PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0114 THEY MUST BE PLACED FAR ENOUGH ON THE PLATE SO THAT THERE IS NO DANGER OF THEIR OVER BALANCING ON TO THE TABLE OR FLOOR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0115 WHEN REMOVED AT THE END OF THE COURSE OTHER TABLE MATTERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0116 THE DISTANCE FROM THE TABLE AT WHICH IT IS BEST TO SIT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0117 IS A MATTER OF PERSONAL COMFORT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0118 A CHILD SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE SO CLOSE THAT HIS ELBOWS ARE BENT LIKE A GRASSHOPPER'S
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0119 NOR SO FAR BACK THAT FOOD IS APT TO BE SPILLED IN TRANSIT FROM PLATE TO MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0120 CHILDREN LIKE TO DRINK VERY LONG AND RAPIDLY ALL IN ONE BREATH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0121 UNTIL THEY ARE PINK AROUND THE EYES AND ARE LITERALLY GASPING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0122 THEY ALSO LOVE TO PUT THEIR WHOLE HANDS IN THEIR FINGER BOWLS AND WIGGLE THEIR FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0123 A BABY OF TWO OR AT LEAST BY THE TIME HE IS THREE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0124 SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO DIP THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS IN THE FINGER BOWL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0125 WITHOUT PLAYING DRAW THE FINGERS OF THE RIGHT HAND ACROSS HIS MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0126 AND THEN WIPE HIS LIPS AND FINGERS ON THE APRON OF HIS BIB
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0127 NO SMALL CHILD CAN BE EXPECTED TO USE A NAPKIN INSTEAD OF A BIB
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0128 NO MATTER HOW NICELY BEHAVED HE MAY BE THERE IS ALWAYS DANGER OF HIS SPILLING SOMETHING SOME TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0129 SOFT BOILED EGG IS HIDEOUSLY DIFFICULT TO EAT WITHOUT EVER GETTING A DROP OF IT DOWN THE FRONT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0130 AND IT IS MUCH EASIER TO SUPPLY HIM WITH A CLEAN BIB FOR THE NEXT MEAL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0131 THAN TO CHANGE HIS DRESS FOR THE NEXT MOMENT VERY LITTLE CHILDREN USUALLY HAVE HOT WATER PLATES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0132 THAT ARE SPECIALLY MADE LIKE A DOUBLE PLATE WITH HOT WATER SPACE BETWEEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0133 ON WHICH THE MEAT IS CUT UP AND THE VEGETABLES FIXED IN THE PANTRY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0134 AND BROUGHT TO THE CHILDREN BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE TABLE ARE SERVED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0135 NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS HARD FOR THEM TO BE MADE TO WAIT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0136 AND HAVE THEIR ATTENTION ATTRACTED BY FOOD NOT FOR THEM BUT BECAUSE THEY TAKE SO LONG TO EAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0137 AS SOON AS THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO EAT EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE THEY ARE SERVED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0138 NOT LAST BUT IN THE REGULAR ROTATION AT TABLE IN WHICH THEY COME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0139 TABLE TRICKS THAT MUST BE CORRECTED TO SIT UP STRAIGHT AND KEEP THEIR HANDS IN THEIR LAPS WHEN NOT OCCUPIED WITH EATING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0140 IS VERY HARD FOR A CHILD BUT SHOULD BE INSISTED UPON IN ORDER TO PREVENT A CARELESS ATTITUDE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0141 THAT ALL TOO READILY DEGENERATES INTO FLOPPING THIS WAY AND THAT AND INTO FINGERING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0142 WHATEVER IS IN REACH HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO WARM HIS HANDS ON HIS PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0143 OR DRUM ON THE TABLE OR SCREW HIS NAPKIN INTO A ROPE OR MAKE MARKS ON THE TABLECLOTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0144 IF HE SHOWS TALENT AS AN ARTIST GIVE HIM PENCILS OR MODELING WAX IN HIS PLAYROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0145 BUT DO NOT LET HIM BITE HIS SLICE OF BREAD INTO THE SILHOUETTE OF AN ANIMAL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0146 OR MODEL FIGURES IN SOFT BREAD AT THE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0147 AND DO NOT ALLOW HIM TO CONSTRUCT A TENT OUT OF TWO FORKS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0148 OR AN AUTOMOBILE CHASSIS OUT OF TUMBLERS AND KNIVES FOOD AND TABLE IMPLEMENTS ARE NOT PLAYTHINGS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0149 NOR IS THE DINING ROOM A PLAYGROUND TALKING AT TABLE WHEN OLDER PEOPLE ARE PRESENT AT TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0150 AND A CHILD WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING HE MUST BE TAUGHT TO STOP EATING MOMENTARILY AND LOOK AT HIS MOTHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0151 WHO AT THE FIRST PAUSE IN THE CONVERSATION WILL SAY WHAT IS IT DEAR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0152 AND THE CHILD THEN HAS HIS SAY IF HE WANTS MERELY TO LAUNCH FORTH ON A LONG SUBJECT OF HIS OWN CONVERSATION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0153 HIS MOTHER SAYS NOT NOW DARLING WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT BY AND BY OR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0154 DON'T YOU SEE THAT MOTHER IS TALKING TO AUNT MARY WHEN CHILDREN ARE AT TABLE ALONE WITH THEIR MOTHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0155 THEY SHOULD NOT ONLY BE ALLOWED TO TALK BUT UNCONSCIOUSLY TRAINED IN TABLE CONVERSATION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0156 AS WELL AS IN TABLE MANNERS CHILDREN ARE ALL MORE OR LESS LITTLE MONKEYS IN THAT THEY IMITATE EVERYTHING THEY SEE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0157 IF THEIR MOTHER TREATS THEM EXACTLY AS SHE DOES HER VISITORS THEY IN TURN PLAY VISITOR TO PERFECTION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0158 NOTHING HURTS THE FEELINGS OF CHILDREN MORE THAN NOT BEING ALLOWED TO BEHAVE LIKE GROWN PERSONS WHEN THEY THINK THEY ARE ABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0159 TO BE HELPED TO BE FED TO HAVE THEIR FOOD CUT UP
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0160 ALL HAVE A STULTIFYING EFFECT UPON THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS SOON AS THEY HAVE BECOME EXPERT ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT THESE SERVICES FOR THEMSELVES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0161 CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT FROM THE TIME THEY ARE LITTLE NOT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE AND DON'T LIKE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0162 A CHILD WHO IS NOT ALLOWED TO SAY ANYTHING BUT NO THANK YOU AT HOME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0163 WILL NOT MORTIFY HIS MOTHER IN PUBLIC BY SCREAMING I HATE STEAK I WON'T EAT POTATO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0164 I WANT ICE CREAM QUIETNESS AT TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0165 OLDER CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO JERK OUT THEIR CHAIRS TO FLOP DOWN SIDEWAYS TO FLICK THEIR NAPKINS BY ONE CORNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0166 TO REACH OUT FOR SOMETHING OR BEGIN TO EAT NUTS FRUIT OR OTHER TABLE DECORATIONS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0167 A CHILD AS WELL AS A GROWN PERSON SHOULD SIT DOWN QUIETLY IN THE CENTER OF HIS CHAIR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0168 AND DRAW IT UP TO THE TABLE IF THERE IS NO ONE TO PUSH IT IN FOR HIM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0169 BY HOLDING THE SEAT IN EITHER HAND WHILE MOMENTARILY LIFTING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0170 HE MUST NOT JUMP OR ROCK HIS CHAIR INTO PLACE AT THE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0171 IN GETTING UP FROM THE TABLE AGAIN HE MUST PUSH HIS CHAIR BACK QUIETLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0172 USING HIS HANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CHAIR SEAT AND NOT BY HOLDING ON TO THE TABLE EDGE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0173 AND GIVING HIMSELF CHAIR AND ALL A SUDDEN SHOVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0174 THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A SOUND MADE BY THE PUSHING IN OR OUT OF CHAIRS AT TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0175 THE SPOILED CHILD THE BAD MANNERS OF AMERICAN CHILDREN WHICH UNFORTUNATELY ARE SUPPOSED BY FOREIGNERS TO BE TYPICAL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0176 ARE NEARLY ALWAYS THE RESULT OF THEIR BEING GIVEN STAR PARTS BY OVER FOND BUT EQUALLY OVER FOOLISH MOTHERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0177 IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO BRING TO MIND THE MOST IRRITATING AND OBJECTIONABLE CHILD ONE KNOWS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0178 AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT ITS MOTHER CONTINUALLY THROWS THE SPOTLIGHT ON IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0179 BY TALKING TO IT AND ABOUT IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0180 AND BY CALLING ATTENTION TO ITS LOOKS OR ITS CUNNING WAYS OR EVEN POSSIBLY ITS NAUGHTINESS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0181 IT IS HUMANLY NATURAL TO MAKE A FUSS OVER LITTLE CHILDREN PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE PRETTY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0182 AND IT TAKES QUITE SUPER HUMAN CONTROL FOR A YOUNG MOTHER NOT TO SHOW OFF HER TREASURE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0183 BUT TO SAY INSTEAD PLEASE DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0184 SOME CHILDREN WHO ARE ESPECIALLY FREE FROM SELF CONSCIOUSNESS STAND STARDOM BETTER THAN OTHERS WHO ARE MORE READILY SPOILED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0185 BUT IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE OLD FASHIONED METHOD THAT ASSIGNED CHILDREN TO INCONSPICUOUS PLACES IN THE BACKGROUND
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0186 AND DECREED THEY MIGHT BE SEEN BUT NOT HEARD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0187 PRODUCED MEN AND WOMEN OF FAR GREATER CHARM THAN THE MODERN METHOD OF ENCOURAGING PUBLIC SELF EXPRESSION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0188 FROM INFANCY UPWARD CHIEF VIRTUE OBEDIENCE NO YOUNG HUMAN BEING ANY MORE THAN A YOUNG DOG
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0189 HAS THE LEAST CLAIM TO ATTRACTIVENESS UNLESS IT IS TRAINED TO MANNERS AND OBEDIENCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0190 THE CHILD THAT WHINES INTERRUPTS FUSSES FIDGETS AND DOES NOTHING THAT IT IS TOLD TO DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0191 HAS NOT THE LEAST POWER OF ATTRACTION FOR ANY ONE EVEN THOUGH IT MAY HAVE THE FEATURES OF AN ANGEL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0192 AND BE DRESSED LIKE A PICTURE ANOTHER THAT MAY HAVE NO CLAIM TO BEAUTY WHATEVER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0193 BUT THAT IS SWEET AND NICELY BEHAVED EXERTS CHARM OVER EVERY ONE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0194 WHEN POSSIBLE A CHILD SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY THE INSTANT IT BECOMES DISOBEDIENT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0195 IT SOON LEARNS THAT IT CAN NOT STAY WITH MOTHER UNLESS IT IS WELL BEHAVED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0196 THIS MEANS THAT IT LEARNS SELF CONTROL IN BABYHOOD NOT ONLY MUST CHILDREN OBEY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0197 BUT THEY MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SHOW OFF OR BECOME PERT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0198 OR TO CONTRADICT OR TO ANSWER BACK AND AFTER HAVING BEEN TOLD NO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0199 THEY MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED BY PERSISTENT NAGGING TO WIN YES A CHILD THAT LOSES ITS TEMPER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0200 THAT TEASES THAT IS PETULANT AND DISOBEDIENT AND A NUISANCE TO EVERYBODY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0201 IS MERELY A VICTIM POOR LITTLE THING OF PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN TOO INCOMPETENT OR NEGLIGENT TO TRAIN IT TO OBEDIENCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0202 MOREOVER THAT SAME CHILD WHEN GROWN WILL BE THE FIRST TO RESENT AND BLAME THE MOTHER'S MISTAKEN SPOILING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0203 AND LACK OF GOOD SENSE FAIR PLAY NOTHING APPEALS TO CHILDREN MORE THAN JUSTICE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0204 AND THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN THE NURSERY TO PLAY FAIR IN GAMES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0205 TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S PROPERTY AND RIGHTS TO GIVE CREDIT TO OTHERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0206 AND NOT TO TAKE TOO MUCH CREDIT TO THEMSELVES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0207 EVERY CHILD MUST BE TAUGHT NEVER TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE MEAGRE POSSESSIONS OF ANOTHER CHILD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0208 WHOSE PARENTS ARE NOT AS WELL OFF AS HER OWN A PURSE PROUD OVERBEARING CHILD WHO SAYS TO A PLAYMATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0209 MY CLOTHES WERE ALL MADE IN PARIS AND MY DOLL IS EVER SO MUCH HANDSOMER THAN YOURS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0210 OR IS THAT REAL LACE ON YOUR COLLAR IS NOT IMPRESSING HER YOUNG FRIEND WITH HER GRANDEUR AND DISCRIMINATION
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0211 BUT WITH HER DISAGREEABLENESS AND RUDENESS A BOY WHO BRAGS ABOUT WHAT HE HAS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0212 AND BOASTS OF WHAT HE CAN DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0213 IS ONLY LESS OBJECTIONABLE BECAUSE OTHER BOYS ARE SURE TO TAKE IT OUT OF HIM PROMPTLY AND THOROUGHLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0214 NOR SHOULD A BRIGHT OBSERVING CHILD BE ENCOURAGED TO PICK OUT OTHER PEOPLE'S FAILINGS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0215 OR TO TELL HER MOTHER HOW INFERIOR OTHER CHILDREN ARE COMPARED WITH HERSELF
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0216 IF SHE WINS A RACE OR A MEDAL OR IS PRAISED SHE NATURALLY TELLS HER MOTHER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0217 AND HER MOTHER NATURALLY REJOICES WITH HER AND IT IS PROPER THAT SHE SHOULD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0218 BUT A WISE MOTHER DIRECTS HER CHILD'S MENTAL ATTITUDE TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT ARROGANCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0219 SELFISHNESS AND CONCEIT CAN WIN NO PLACE WORTH HAVING IN THE WORLD CHILDREN AT AFTERNOON TEA
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0220 A CUSTOM IN MANY FASHIONABLE HOUSES IS TO ALLOW CHILDREN AS SOON AS THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0221 TO COME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM OR LIBRARY AT TEA TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0222 AS NOTHING GIVES THEM A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN HOW TO BEHAVE IN COMPANY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0223 LITTLE BOYS ARE ALWAYS TAUGHT TO BOW TO VISITORS LITTLE GIRLS TO CURTSY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0224 SMALL BOYS ARE TAUGHT TO PLACE THE INDIVIDUAL TABLES HAND PLATES AND TEA
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0225 AND PASS SANDWICHES AND CAKES IF THERE ARE NO BOYS GIRLS PERFORM THIS OFFICE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0226 VERY OFTEN THEY BOTH DO WHEN EVERYBODY HAS BEEN HELPED THE CHILDREN ARE PERHAPS ALLOWED A PIECE OF CAKE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0227 WHICH THEY PUT ON A TEA PLATE AND SIT DOWN AND EAT NICELY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0228 BUT AS THE TEA HOUR IS VERY NEAR THEIR SUPPER TIME THEY ARE OFTEN ALLOWED NOTHING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0229 AND AFTER MAKING THEMSELVES USEFUL GO OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0230 IF MANY PEOPLE ARE PRESENT AND THE CHILDREN ARE NOT SPOKEN TO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0231 THEY LEAVE THE ROOM UNOBTRUSIVELY AND QUIETLY IF ONLY ONE OR TWO ARE PRESENT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0232 ESPECIALLY THOSE WHOM THE CHILDREN KNOW WELL THEY SHAKE HANDS AND SAY GOOD BY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0233 AND WALK NOT RUN OUT OF THE ROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0234 THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WELL BRED PEOPLE BECOME USED FROM CHILDHOOD TO INSTINCTIVE GOOD MANNERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0235 UNLESS THEY ARE SPOKEN TO THEY WOULD NOT THINK OF SPEAKING OR MAKING THEMSELVES NOTICED IN ANY WAY VERY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0236 LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAVE NOT REACHED THE AGE OF DISCRETION WHICH MAY BE PLACED AT ABOUT FIVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0237 POSSIBLY NOT UNTIL SIX USUALLY GO IN THE DRAWING ROOM AT TEA TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0238 ONLY WHEN NEAR RELATIVES OR INTIMATE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY ARE THERE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0239 NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS WASHED AND DRESSED SOME CHILDREN WEAR SPECIAL AFTERNOON CLOTHES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0240 BUT USUALLY THE CLEAN CLOTHES PUT ON AT TEA TIME GO ON AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0241 EXCEPT THE THIN SOCKS AND HOUSE SLIPPERS WHICH ARE RESERVED FOR THE EVENING HOUR OF THEIR DAY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0242 CHILDREN'S PARTIES A SMALL GIRL OR BOY GIVING A PARTY SHOULD RECEIVE WITH HER MOTHER AT THE DOOR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0243 AND GREET ALL HER FRIENDS AS THEY COME IN IF IT IS HER BIRTHDAY AND OTHER CHILDREN BRING HER GIFTS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0244 SHE MUST SAY THANK YOU POLITELY ON NO ACCOUNT MUST SHE BE ALLOWED TO TELL A CHILD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0245 I HATE DOLLS IF A FRIEND HAS BROUGHT HER ONE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0246 SHE MUST LEARN AT AN EARLY AGE THAT AS HOSTESS SHE MUST THINK OF HER GUESTS RATHER THAN HERSELF
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0247 AND NOT WANT THE BEST TOYS IN THE GRAB BAG OR SCREAM BECAUSE ANOTHER CHILD GETS THE PRIZE THAT IS OFFERED IN A CONTEST
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0248 IF BEATEN IN A GAME A LITTLE GIRL NO LESS THAN HER BROTHERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0249 MUST NEVER CRY OR COMPLAIN THAT THE CONTEST IS NOT FAIR WHEN SHE LOSES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0250 SHE MUST TRY TO HELP HER GUESTS HAVE A GOOD TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0251 AND NOT INSIST ON PLAYING THE GAME SHE LIKES INSTEAD OF THOSE WHICH THE OTHER CHILDREN SUGGEST
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0252 WHEN SHE HERSELF GOES TO A PARTY SHE MUST SAY HOW DO YOU DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0253 WHEN SHE ENTERS THE ROOM AND CURTSY TO THE LADY WHO RECEIVES A BOY MAKES A BOW
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0254 THEY SHOULD HAVE EQUALLY GOOD MANNERS AS WHEN AT HOME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0255 AND NOT TRY TO GRAB MORE THAN THEIR SHARE OF FAVORS OR TOYS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0256 WHEN IT IS TIME TO GO HOME THEY MUST SAY GOOD BY I HAD A VERY GOOD TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0257 OR GOOD BY THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH THE CHILD'S REPLY IF THE HOSTESS SAYS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0258 GOOD BY GIVE MY LOVE TO YOUR MOTHER THE CHILD ANSWERS YES MRS SMITH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0259 IN ALL MONOSYLLABIC REPLIES A CHILD MUST NOT SAY YES OR NO OR WHAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0260 A BOY IN ANSWERING A GENTLEMAN STILL USES THE OLD FASHIONED YES SIR NO SIR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0261 I THINK SO SIR BUT MA'AM HAS GONE OUT OF STYLE BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS MUST THEREFORE ANSWER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0262 NO MRS SMITH YES MISS JONES A GIRL SAYS YES MR SMITH RATHER THAN SIR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0263 ALL CHILDREN SHOULD SAY WHAT DID YOU SAY MOTHER NO FATHER THANK YOU AUNT KATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0264 YES UNCLE FRED ETC THEY NEED NOT INSERT A NAME IN A LONG SENTENCE NOR WITH PLEASE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0265 OR THANK YOU YES PLEASE OR NO THANK YOU IS QUITE SUFFICIENT OR IN ANSWERING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0266 I JUST SAW MARY DOWN IN THE GARDEN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ADD MRS SMITH AT THE END
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0267 ETIQUETTE FOR GROWN CHILDREN ETIQUETTE FOR GROWN CHILDREN IS PRECISELY THE SAME AS FOR GROWN PERSONS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0268 EXCEPTING THAT IN MANY WAYS THE MANNERS EXACTED OF YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE MORE ALERT AND PUNCTILIOUS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0269 YOUNG GIRLS AND BOYS OF COURSE SHOULD HAVE THE MANNERS OF A GENTLEMAN RATHER THAN THOSE OF A LADY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0270 IN THAT A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS RISES RELINQUISHES THE BEST SEAT AND WALKS LAST INTO A ROOM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0271 WHEREAS THESE COURTESIES ARE SHOWN TO AND NOT OBSERVED BY LADIES EXCEPT TO OTHER LADIES OLDER THAN THEMSELVES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0272 IN GIVING PARTIES YOUNG GIRLS SEND OUT THEIR INVITATIONS AS THEIR MOTHERS DO
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0273 AND THEIR DEPORTMENT IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THEIR DEBUTANTE SISTER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0274 BOYS BEHAVE AS THEIR FATHERS DO AND ARE EQUALLY PUNCTILIOUS IN FOLLOWING THE CODE OF HONOR OF ALL GENTLEMEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0275 THE ONLY DETAILS THEREFORE NOT LIKELY TO BE DESCRIBED IN OTHER CHAPTERS OF THIS BOOK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0276 ARE A FEW ADMONITIONS ON TABLE MANNERS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT ABOVE KINDERGARTEN GRADE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0277 THE GRADUATING TESTS IN TABLE MANNERS A YOUNG PERSON MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE GRADUATED FROM THE SCHOOL OF TABLE ETIQUETTE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0278 WHEN SHE OR HE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0279 WOULD BE ABLE TO SIT AT A FORMAL LUNCH OR DINNER TABLE AND FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN EATING PROPERLY ANY OF THE COMESTIBLES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HURDLES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0280 TO THE INEXPERT CORN ON THE COB
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0281 CORN ON THE COB COULD BE ELIMINATED SO FAR AS EVER HAVING TO EAT IT IN FORMAL COMPANY IS CONCERNED
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0282 SINCE IT IS NEVER SERVED AT A LUNCHEON OR A DINNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0283 BUT IF YOU INSIST ON EATING IT AT HOME OR IN A RESTAURANT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0284 TO ATTACK IT WITH AS LITTLE FEROCITY AS POSSIBLE IS PERHAPS THE ONLY DIRECTION TO BE GIVEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0285 SINCE AT BEST IT IS AN UNGRACEFUL PERFORMANCE AND TO EAT IT GREEDILY A HORRIBLE SIGHT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0286 ASPARAGUS ALTHOUGH ASPARAGUS MAY BE TAKEN IN THE FINGERS DON'T TAKE A LONG DROOPING STALK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0287 HOLD IT UP IN THE AIR AND CATCH THE END OF IT IN YOUR MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0288 LIKE A FISH WHEN THE STALKS ARE THIN IT IS BEST TO CUT THEM IN HALF WITH THE FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0289 EATING THE TIPS LIKE ALL FORK FOOD THE ENDS MAY THEN BE TAKEN IN THE FINGERS AND EATEN WITHOUT A DROPPING FOUNTAIN EFFECT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0290 DON'T SQUEEZE THE STALKS OR HOLD YOUR HAND BELOW THE END AND LET THE JUICE RUN DOWN YOUR ARM
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0291 ARTICHOKES ARTICHOKES ARE ALWAYS EATEN WITH THE FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0293 AND THEN BITTEN OFF BREAD AND BUTTER BREAD SHOULD ALWAYS BE BROKEN INTO SMALL PIECES WITH THE FINGERS BEFORE BEING EATEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0294 IF IT IS TO BE BUTTERED AT LUNCH BREAKFAST OR SUPPER BUT NOT AT DINNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0295 A PIECE IS HELD ON THE EDGE OF THE BREAD AND BUTTER PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0296 OR THE PLACE PLATE AND ENOUGH BUTTER SPREAD ON IT FOR A MOUTHFUL OR TWO AT A TIME
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0297 WITH A SMALL SILVER BUTTER KNIFE BREAD MUST NEVER BE HELD FLAT ON THE PALM OF THE HAND AND BUTTERED IN THE AIR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0298 IF THE REGULAR STEEL KNIFE IS USED CARE MUST BE TAKEN NOT TO SMEAR FOOD FROM THE KNIFE'S SIDE ON THE BUTTER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0299 ANY FOOD THAT IS SMEARED ABOUT IS LOATHSOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEAUTIFUL TABLE MANNERS ALWAYS KEEP THEIR PLACES AT TABLE NEAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0300 PEOPLE WITH DISGUSTING MANNERS GET EVERYTHING IN A HORRIBLE MESS THE MANAGEMENT OF BONES AND PITS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0301 TERRAPIN BONES FISH BONES AND GRAPE SEED MUST BE EATEN QUITE BARE AND CLEAN IN THE MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0302 AND REMOVED ONE AT A TIME BETWEEN FINGER AND THUMB
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0303 ALL SPITTING OUT OF BONES AND PITS INTO THE PLATE IS DISGUSTING IF FOOD IS TOO HOT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0304 QUICKLY TAKE A SWALLOW OF WATER ON NO ACCOUNT SPIT IT OUT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0305 IF FOOD HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO YOUR MOUTH NO MATTER HOW YOU HATE IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0306 YOU HAVE GOT TO SWALLOW IT IT IS UNFORGIVABLE TO TAKE ANYTHING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN IT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0307 EXCEPT DRY BONES AND STONES TO SPIT ANYTHING WHATEVER INTO THE CORNER OF YOUR NAPKIN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0308 IS TOO NAUSEATING TO COMMENT ON
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0309 IT IS HORRID TO SEE ANY ONE SPIT SKINS OR PITS ON A FORK OR INTO THE PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0310 THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE ANYTHING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS BETWEEN FIRST FINGER AND THUMB
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0311 DRY GRAPE SEEDS OR CHERRY PITS CAN BE DROPPED FROM THE LIPS INTO THE CUPPED HAND
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0312 PEACHES OR OTHER VERY JUICY FRUITS ARE PEELED AND THEN EATEN WITH KNIFE AND FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0313 BUT DRY FRUITS SUCH AS APPLES MAY BE CUT AND THEN EATEN IN THE FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0314 NEVER WIPE HANDS THAT HAVE FRUIT JUICE ON THEM ON A NAPKIN WITHOUT FIRST USING A FINGER BOWL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0315 BECAUSE FRUIT JUICES MAKE INDELIBLE STAINS BIRDS BIRDS ARE NOT EATEN WITH THE FINGERS IN COMPANY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0316 YOU CUT OFF AS MUCH OF THE MEAT AS YOU CAN AND LEAVE THE REST ON YOUR PLATE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0317 FORKS OR FINGERS ALL JUICY OR GOOEY FRUITS OR CAKES ARE BEST EATEN WITH A FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0318 BUT IN MOST CASES IT IS A MATTER OF DEXTERITY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0319 IF YOU ARE ABLE TO EAT A PEACH IN YOUR FINGERS AND NOT SMEAR YOUR FACE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0320 LET JUICE RUN DOWN OR MAKE A SUCKING NOISE YOU ARE THE ONE IN A THOUSAND WHO MAY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0321 AND WITH UTMOST PROPRIETY CONTINUE THE FEAT
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0322 IF YOU CAN EAT A NAPOLEON OR A CREAM PUFF AND NOT LET THE CREAM OOZE OUT ON THE FAR SIDE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0323 YOU NEED NOT USE A FORK BUT IF YOU CAN NOT EAT SOMETHING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0324 NO MATTER WHAT IT IS WITHOUT GETTING IT ALL OVER YOUR FINGERS YOU MUST USE A FORK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0325 AND IF NECESSARY A KNIFE ALSO ALL RULES OF TABLE MANNERS ARE MADE TO AVOID UGLINESS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0326 TO LET ANY ONE SEE WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR MOUTH IS REPULSIVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0327 TO MAKE A NOISE IS TO SUGGEST AN ANIMAL TO MAKE A MESS IS DISGUSTING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0328 ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TRIFLING DECREES OF ETIQUETTE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0329 THAT ARE MERELY FINICAL UNREASONABLE AND SILLY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0330 WHY ONE SHOULD NOT CUT ONE'S SALAD IN SMALL PIECES IF ONE WANTS TO MAKES LITTLE SENSE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0331 UNLESS ONE WANTS TO CUT UP A WHOLE PLATEFUL AND MAKE THE PLATE MESSY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0332 A STEEL KNIFE MUST NOT BE USED FOR SALAD OR FRUIT BECAUSE IT TURNS BLACK
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0333 TO CONDEMN THE AMERICAN CUSTOM OF EATING A SOFT BOILED EGG IN A GLASS OR CUP
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0334 BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE THE ENGLISH FASHION TO SCOOP IT THROUGH THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE SHELL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0335 IS ABOUT AS REASONABLE AS THOUGH WE WERE TO PROCLAIM ENGLISH MANNERS BAD BECAUSE THEY TAG A BREAKFAST DISH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0336 CALLED A SAVORY OF FISH ROE OR SOMETHING EQUALLY INAPPROPRIATE AFTER THE DESSERT AT DINNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0337 MANY OTHER ARBITRARY RULES FOR EATING FOOD WITH FORK SPOON OR FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0338 ARE ALSO STUMBLING BLOCKS RATHER THAN AIDS TO SMOOTHNESS AS SAID ABOVE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0339 ONE EATS WITH A FORK OR SPOON FINGER FOODS THAT ARE MESSY AND STICKY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0340 ONE EATS WITH THE FINGER THOSE WHICH ARE DRY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0341 IT IS TRUE THAT ONE SHOULD NOT EAT FRENCH FRIED POTATOES OR SARATOGA CHIPS IN FINGERS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0342 BUT THAT IS BECAUSE THEY BELONG TO THE MEAT COURSE SEPARATE VEGETABLE SAUCERS ARE NEVER PUT ON A FASHIONABLE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0343 NEITHER IS BUTTER ALLOWED AT DINNER THEREFORE BOTH MUST BE AVOIDED IN COMPANY BECAUSE COMPANY IS FORMAL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0344 AND ETIQUETTE IS FIRST AID ALWAYS TO FORMALITY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0345 BUT IF A MAN IN HIS OWN HOUSE LIKES BUTTER WITH HIS DINNER OR A SAUCER FOR HIS TOMATOES
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0346 HE IS BREAKING THE RULE OF FASHION TO HAVE THEM BUT HE IS SCARCELY COMMITTING AN OFFENSE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0347 IN THE SAME WAY IF HE LIKES TO EAT A CHICKEN WING OR A SQUAB LEG IN HIS FINGERS HE CAN ASK FOR A FINGER BOWL
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0348 THE REAL OBJECTION TO EATING WITH THE FINGERS IS GETTING THEM GREASY OR STICKY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0349 AND TO SUCK THEM OR SMEAR ONE'S NAPKIN IS EQUALLY UNSIGHTLY ON THE SUBJECT OF ELBOWS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0350 ALTHOUGH ELBOWS ON THE TABLE ARE SEEN CONSTANTLY IN HIGHEST FASHIONABLE CIRCLES A
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0351 WHOLE TABLE'S LENGTH OF ELBOWS PLANTED LIKE CLOTHES LINE POLES AND HANDS WAVING GLASSES OR FORKS ABOUT IN BETWEEN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0352 IS NEITHER AN ATTRACTIVE NOR FORTUNATELY AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF A FASHIONABLE DINNER TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0353 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE TOLERATED ELBOW ON TABLE IS USED ONLY ON OCCASION AND FOR A REASON
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0354 AND SHOULD NEITHER BE PERMITTED TO CHILDREN NOR PRACTISED IN THEIR PRESENCE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0355 ELBOWS ARE UNIVERSALLY SEEN ON TABLES IN RESTAURANTS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0356 ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE LUNCHING OR DINING AT A SMALL TABLE OF TWO OR FOUR
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0357 AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ONESELF HEARD ABOVE THE MUSIC BY ONE'S TABLE COMPANIONS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0358 AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT BE HEARD AT OTHER TABLES NEARBY WITHOUT LEANING FAR FORWARD
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0359 AND IN LEANING FORWARD A WOMAN'S FIGURE MAKES A MORE GRACEFUL OUTLINE SUPPORTED ON HER ELBOWS
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0360 THAN DOUBLED FORWARD OVER HER HANDS IN HER LAP AS THOUGH IN PAIN
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0361 AT HOME WHEN THERE IS NO REASON FOR LEANING ACROSS THE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0362 THERE IS NO REASON FOR ELBOWS AND AT A DINNER OF CEREMONY
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0363 ELBOWS ON THE TABLE ARE RARELY SEEN EXCEPT AT THE ENDS OF THE TABLE
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0364 WHERE AGAIN ONE HAS TO LEAN FORWARD IN ORDER TO TALK TO A COMPANION AT A DISTANCE ACROSS THE TABLE CORNER
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0365 ELBOWS ARE NEVER PUT ON THE TABLE WHILE ONE IS EATING
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0366 TO SIT WITH THE LEFT ELBOW PROPPED ON THE TABLE WHILE EATING WITH THE RIGHT HAND
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0367 UNLESS ONE IS ALONE AND ILL OR TO PROP THE RIGHT ONE ON THE TABLE WHILE LIFTING THE FORK OR GLASS TO THE MOUTH
chocoholic-20080420-pos-eti0368 MUST BE AVOIDED END OF CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE
chris-20090325-esw-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
chris-20090325-esw-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM

chris-20090701-scf-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
chris-20090701-scf-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
chris-20090701-scf-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
chris-20090701-scf-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
chris-20090701-scf-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
chris-20090701-scf-a0089 GLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
chris-20090701-scf-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
chris-20090701-scf-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT

chrisdittmar-20130108-udq-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
chrisdittmar-20130108-udq-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
chrisdittmar-20130108-udq-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
chrisdittmar-20130108-udq-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
chrisdittmar-20130108-udq-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
chrisdittmar-20130108-ywz-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
chrisspen-20120505-baa-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
chrisspen-20120505-eam-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
chrisspen-20120505-efq-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
chrisspen-20120505-ftp-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0178 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0179 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
chrisspen-20120505-inl-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
chrisspen-20120505-jzz-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
chrisspen-20120505-kss-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
chrisspen-20120505-luh-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
chrisspen-20120505-uxh-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
chrisspen-20120505-zgz-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
chrisspen-20120511-agv-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
chrisspen-20120724-kol-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
chrisspen-20120826-fqo-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
chrisspen-20120826-kce-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
chrisspen-20120826-oeh-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
chrisspen-20120826-ong-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
chrisspen-20120826-pxy-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
chrisspen-20120826-uff-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
cj5-20090115-cjo-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
clarkjc-20120805-nmq-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
clarkjc-20120805-qpa-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
clarkjc-20120805-qxn-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
clarkjc-20120805-qxn-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY

cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0063 FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0064 AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT

cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0135 DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0136 LIEUTENANT MOORE TOLD THEM THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER THAT THEY HAD SOLD THEIR LANDS TO THE GOVERNMENT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0137 THAT IT BELONGED TO THE WHITE MEN NOW AND THAT THEY HAD AGREED TO LIVE ON THE RESERVATION PROVIDED FOR THEM
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0138 TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0139 AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0140 HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY THE LIEUTENANT BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE REAL MURDERERS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0141 PROMPTLY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AND HAD THEM PLACED IN LINE AND SHOT LIEUTENANT MOORE PURSUED THE FUGITIVES TO MONO
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0142 BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANY OF THEM AFTER BEING HOSPITABLY ENTERTAINED AND PROTECTED BY THE MONO AND PAUTE TRIBES
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0143 THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0144 AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0145 REACHED THEIR YOSEMITE HOME ONCE MORE BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0146 A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0147 ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON THE TENAYA CANYON AND LAKE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0148 WERE NAMED FOR THE FAMOUS OLD CHIEF VERY FEW VISITS WERE MADE TO THE VALLEY BEFORE THE SUMMER OR EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0149 WHEN MR J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0150 AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE AND IN HIS CALIFORNIA MAGAZINE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0151 DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0152 THIS FIRST PARTY WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER FROM MARIPOSA THE SAME YEAR CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERSONS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0153 THE NEXT YEAR THE REGULAR PLEASURE TRAVEL BEGAN AND A TRAIL ON THE MARIPOSA SIDE OF THE VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0154 WAS OPENED BY MANN BROTHERS THIS TRAIL WAS AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0155 AND MADE FREE TO THE PUBLIC THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0156 WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0157 AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0158 AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM IT WAS SITUATED DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE YOSEMITE FALL
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0159 A LITTLE OVER HALF A MILE FARTHER UP THE VALLEY A CANVAS HOUSE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0160 WAS PUT UP IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BY G A HITE NEXT YEAR
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0161 A FRAME HOUSE WAS BUILT AND KEPT AS A HOTEL BY MR PECK
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0162 AFTERWARD BY MR LONGHURST AND SINCE EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR BY MR HUTCHINGS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0163 ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0164 WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0165 IS NOW THE ONLY HOTEL IN THE VALLEY A LARGE HOTEL BUILT BY THE STATE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0166 AND LOCATED FARTHER UP THE VALLEY WAS BURNED TO PROVIDE FOR THE OVERFLOW OF VISITORS
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0167 THERE ARE THREE CAMPS WITH BOARD FLOORS WOOD FRAME AND COVERED WITH CANVAS WELL FURNISHED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0168 SOME OF THEM WITH ELECTRIC LIGHT A LARGE FIRST CLASS HOTEL IS VERY MUCH NEEDED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0169 TRAVEL OF LATE YEARS HAS BEEN RAPIDLY INCREASING ESPECIALLY AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0170 BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0171 AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN OH FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0172 THE GREATEST INCREASE OF COURSE WAS CAUSED BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE YOSEMITE VALLEY RAILROAD FROM MERCED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0173 TO THE BORDER OF THE PARK EIGHT MILES BELOW THE VALLEY IT IS EIGHTY MILES LONG
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0174 AND THE ENTIRE DISTANCE EXCEPT THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MILES FROM THE TOWN OF MERCED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0175 IS BUILT THROUGH THE PRECIPITOUS MERCED RIVER CANYON THE ROADBED WAS VIRTUALLY BLASTED OUT OF THE SOLID ROCK
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0176 FOR THE ENTIRE DISTANCE IN THE CANYON WORK WAS BEGUN IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN OH FIVE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0177 AND THE FIRST TRAIN ENTERED EL PORTAL THE TERMINUS APRIL FIFTEEN NINETEEN OH SEVEN
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0178 MANY MILES OF THE ROAD COST AS MUCH AS A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MILE
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0179 ITS BUSINESS HAS INCREASED FROM FOUR THOUSAND TOURISTS IN THE FIRST YEAR IT WAS OPERATED
cloudmountain-20080420-yos-yos0180 TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND IN NINETEEN TEN END OF SECTION THIRTEEN
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0484 NO SIR EE
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
compmaster-20120512-abd-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
corno1979-20070615-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
corno1979-20070615-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
corno1979-20070615-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
corno1979-20070615-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
corno1979-20070615-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
corno1979-20070615-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
corno1979-20070615-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
corno1979-20070615-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
corno1979-20070615-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
corno1979-20070615-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
corno1979-20070615-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
corno1979-20070615-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
corno1979-20070615-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
corno1979-20070615-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
corno1979-20070615-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
corno1979-20070615-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
corno1979-20070615-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
corno1979-20070615-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
corno1979-20070615-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
corno1979-20070615-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
corno1979-20070615-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
corno1979-20070615-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
corno1979-20070615-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
corno1979-20070615-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
corno1979-20070615-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
corno1979-20070615-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
corno1979-20070615-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
corno1979-20070615-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
corno1979-20070615-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
corno1979-20070615-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
corno1979-20070615-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
corno1979-20080308-xlg-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
corno1979-20080317-ayn-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
corno1979-20080317-ebe-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
corno1979-20080317-kex-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
corno1979-20080317-oxk-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
corno1979-20080520-agj-a0329 AH INDEED
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
corno1979-20080520-ghu-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
corno1979-20080520-jmr-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
corno1979-20080520-vdn-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
corno1979-20080520-xqg-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0300 DOES THE OLD BOY OFTEN GO OFF AT HALF COCK THAT WAY
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
corno1979-20081220-ebp-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
corno1979-20081220-idl-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
corno1979-20081220-qmh-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
corno1979-20081220-quk-b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
corno1979-20081220-smn-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
corno1979-20081220-vba-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
corno1979-20081220-vzq-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
corno1979-20081220-wic-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
corno1979-20081220-yrz-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
corno1979-20090316-len-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
corno1979-20090316-len-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
corno1979-20090316-len-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
corno1979-20090316-len-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
corno1979-20090316-len-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
corno1979-20090316-len-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
corno1979-20090316-len-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
corno1979-20090316-len-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
corno1979-20090316-len-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
corno1979-20090316-len-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
corno1979-20090316-mjl-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
corno1979-20090316-ncj-a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
corno1979-20090316-pnj-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
corno1979-20090316-qan-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
corno1979-20090316-sfh-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
corno1979-20090316-sfh-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
corno1979-20090316-sfh-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
corno1979-20090316-sfh-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
corno1979-20090316-sfh-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
corno1979-20090316-sfh-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
corno1979-20090316-sfh-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
corno1979-20090316-sfh-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED

corno1979-20090316-une-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
corno1979-20090316-une-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
corno1979-20090316-une-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
corno1979-20090316-une-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
corno1979-20090316-une-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
corno1979-20090316-uoi-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY

craig61107-20130902-rzx-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
craig61107-20130902-rzx-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
craig61107-20130902-rzx-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
craig61107-20130902-rzx-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
craig61107-20130902-rzx-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
craig61107-20130902-rzx-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
craniumonempty-20100314-dnz-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL

craniumonempty-20100314-dqy-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
craniumonempty-20100314-dqy-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
craniumonempty-20100314-dqy-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
craniumonempty-20100314-dqy-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
craniumonempty-20100314-dqy-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
craniumonempty-20100314-dqy-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
craniumonempty-20100314-dqy-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
craniumonempty-20100314-dqy-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
craniumonempty-20100314-jbh-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO

craniumonempty-20100314-lmc-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
craniumonempty-20100314-lmc-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
craniumonempty-20100314-lmc-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
craniumonempty-20100314-lmc-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
craniumonempty-20100314-lzu-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
craniumonempty-20100314-nzf-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
craniumonempty-20100314-tlf-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0426 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
craniumonempty-20100314-vfp-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
craniumonempty-20100314-xap-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
craniumonempty-20100314-xxf-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
craniumonempty-20100315-dem-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
craniumonempty-20100315-fpg-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
crxssi-10112006-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
crxssi-10112006-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
crxssi-10112006-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
crxssi-10112006-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
crxssi-10112006-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
crxssi-10112006-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
crxssi-10112006-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
crxssi-10112006-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
crxssi-10112006-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
crxssi-10112006-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
crxssi-10112006-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
crxssi-10112006-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
crxssi-10112006-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
crxssi-10112006-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
crxssi-10112006-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
crxssi-10112006-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
crxssi-10112006-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
crxssi-10112006-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
crxssi-10112006-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
crxssi-10112006-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
crxssi-10112006-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
crxssi-10112006-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
crxssi-10112006-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
crxssi-10112006-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
crxssi-10112006-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
crxssi-10112006-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
crxssi-10112006-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
crxssi-10112006-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
crxssi-10112006-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
crxssi-10112006-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
crxssi-10112006-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
crxssi-10112006-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
crxssi-10112006-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
crxssi-10112006-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
crxssi-10112006-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
crxssi-10112006-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
crxssi-10112006-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
crxssi-10112006-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
crxssi-10112006-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
crxssi-10112006-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
crxssi-10112006-rp001 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
crxssi-10112006-rp002 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
crxssi-10112006-rp003 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
crxssi-10112006-rp004 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
crxssi-10112006-rp005 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
crxssi-10112006-rp006 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
crxssi-10112006-rp007 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
crxssi-10112006-rp008 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
crxssi-10112006-rp009 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
crxssi-10112006-rp010 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
crxssi-10112006-rp011 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
crxssi-10112006-rp012 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
crxssi-10112006-rp013 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
crxssi-10112006-rp014 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
crxssi-10112006-rp015 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
crxssi-10112006-rp016 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
crxssi-10112006-rp017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
crxssi-10112006-rp018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
crxssi-10112006-rp019 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
crxssi-10112006-rp020 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
crxssi-10112006-rp021 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
crxssi-10112006-rp022 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
crxssi-10112006-rp023 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
crxssi-10112006-rp024 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
crxssi-10112006-rp025 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
crxssi-10112006-rp026 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
crxssi-10112006-rp027 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
crxssi-10112006-rp028 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
crxssi-10112006-rp029 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
crxssi-10112006-rp030 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
crxssi-10112006-rp031 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
d1-20111214-eip-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
d1-20111214-eip-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
d1-20111214-eip-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
d1-20111214-eip-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
d1-20111214-eip-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
d1-20111214-eip-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
d1-20111214-eip-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
d1-20111214-eip-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
d1-20111214-eip-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
d1-20111214-eip-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
d2-20111215-mlb-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
d2-20111215-mlb-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
d2-20111215-mlb-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
d2-20111215-mlb-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
d2-20111215-mlb-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
d2-20111215-mlb-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
d2-20111215-mlb-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
d2-20111215-mlb-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
d2-20111215-mlb-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
d2-20111215-mlb-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
dabbitabbi-20100813-hxf-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
dabbitabbi-20100817-ktt-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
daleyjem-20101107-ubr-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
damastafunk-20110914-kbd-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
dameko-20110623-msp-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
dameko-20110623-msp-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
dameko-20110623-msp-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
dameko-20110623-msp-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
dameko-20110623-msp-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
dameko-20110623-msp-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
dameko-20110623-msp-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
dameko-20110623-msp-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
dameko-20110623-msp-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
dancor-20101004-ojj-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
dancor-20101004-xmb-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
dancor-20101004-xmb-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
dancor-20101004-xmb-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
dancor-20101004-xmb-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
dancor-20101004-xmb-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
dancor-20101004-xmb-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
dancor-20101004-xmb-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
dancor-20101004-xmb-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE

dankishleech-20130111-pdn-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
dankishleech-20130111-pdn-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
dankishleech-20130111-pdn-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
dankishleech-20130111-pdn-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
dankishleech-20130111-pdn-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
dankishleech-20130111-pdn-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
dankishleech-20130111-pdn-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
dankishleech-20130111-pdn-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
daos-20100309-cad-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
daos-20100309-cad-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
daos-20100309-cad-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
daos-20100309-cad-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
daos-20100309-cad-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
daos-20100309-cad-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
daos-20100309-cad-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
daos-20100309-cad-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
daos-20100309-cad-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
daos-20100309-cad-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED

darren-20110423-bxr-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
darren-20110423-bxr-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
darren-20110423-bxr-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
darren-20110423-bxr-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
darren-20110423-bxr-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
darren-20110423-bxr-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
darren-20110423-bxr-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
darren-20110423-bxr-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
dbrenner-20120624-sqc-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
dbrenner-20120624-yja-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
dgd-20100408-vik-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
dgd-20100408-vik-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
dgd-20100408-vik-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
dgd-20100408-vik-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
dgd-20100408-vik-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
dgd-20100408-vik-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
dgd-20100408-vik-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
dgd-20100408-vik-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
dgd-20100408-vik-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
dgd-20100410-smj-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
dgd-20100410-smj-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
dgd-20100410-smj-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
dgd-20100410-smj-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
dgd-20100410-smj-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
dgd-20100410-smj-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
dgd-20100410-smj-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
dgd-20100410-smj-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
dgd-20100410-smj-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
dgd-20100411-kil-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
dgd-20100411-kil-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
dgd-20100411-kil-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
dgd-20100411-kil-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
dgd-20100411-kil-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
dgd-20100411-kil-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
dgd-20100411-kil-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
dgd-20100411-kil-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
dgd-20100411-kil-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
dgd-20100411-kil-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
dhy-20110323-ter-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
dhy-20110323-ter-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
dhy-20110323-ter-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
dhy-20110323-ter-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
dhy-20110323-ter-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
dhy-20110323-ter-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
dhy-20110323-ter-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
dhy-20110323-ter-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
dhy-20110323-ter-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
dhy-20110323-ter-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
dhy2-20110323-hzg-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES

ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0007 CHAPTER ONE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0008 AS SURE AS YOU'RE ALIVE NOW PETER RABBIT SOME DAY I WILL CATCH YOU SNARLED REDDY FOX
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0009 AS HE POKED HIS BLACK NOSE IN THE HOLE BETWEEN THE ROOTS OF THE BIG HICKORY TREE WHICH GROWS CLOSE TO THE SMILING POOL
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0010 IT IS LUCKY FOR YOU THAT YOU WERE NOT ONE JUMP FARTHER AWAY FROM THIS HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0011 PETER SAFE INSIDE THAT HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0012 DIDN'T HAVE A WORD TO SAY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0013 OR IF HE DID
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0014 HE DIDN'T HAVE BREATH ENOUGH TO SAY IT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0015 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT IF HE HAD BEEN ONE JUMP FARTHER FROM THAT HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0016 REDDY FOX WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0017 AS IT WAS THE HAIRS ON PETER'S FUNNY WHITE TAIL ACTUALLY HAD TICKLED REDDY'S BACK
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0018 AS PETER PLUNGED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0019 FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE ROOT BOUND ENTRANCE TO THAT HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0020 IT HAD BEEN THE NARROWEST ESCAPE PETER HAD HAD
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0021 FOR A LONG LONG TIME
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0022 YOU SEE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0023 REDDY FOX HAD SURPRISED PETER NIBBLING SWEET CLOVER ON THE BANK OF THE SMILING POND
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0024 AND IT HAD BEEN A LUCKY THING FOR PETER THAT THAT HOLE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0025 DUG LONG AGO BY JOHNNY CHUCK'S GRANDFATHER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0026 HAD BEEN RIGHT WHERE IT WAS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0027 ALSO IT WAS A LUCKY THING THAT OLD MR CHUCK HAD BEEN WISE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE ENTRANCE BETWEEN THE ROOTS OF THAT TREE IN SUCH A WAY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0028 THAT IT COULD NOT BE DUG ANY LARGER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0029 REDDY FOX WAS TOO SHREWD TO WASTE ANY TIME TRYING TO DIG IT LARGER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0030 HE KNEW THERE WASN'T ROOM ENOUGH FOR HIM TO GET BETWEEN THOSE ROOTS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0031 SO AFTER TRYING TO MAKE PETER AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE BY TELLING HIM WHAT HE REDDY WOULD DO TO HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0032 WHEN HE DID CATCH HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0033 REDDY TROTTED OFF ACROSS THE GREEN MEADOWS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0034 PETER REMAINED WHERE HE WAS FOR A LONG TIME
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0035 WHEN HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT IT WAS SAFE TO DO SO
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0036 CREPT OUT AND HURRIED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0037 UP TO THE OLD ORCHARD
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0038 HE FELT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAFEST PLACE FOR HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0039 BECAUSE THERE WERE EVER SO MANY HIDING PLACES IN THE OLD STONE WALL ALONG THE EDGE OF IT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0040 WHEN PETER REACHED THE OLD ORCHARD
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0041 WHO SHOULD HE SEE BUT JENNY WREN
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0042 JENNY HAD ARRIVED THAT VERY MORNING FROM THE SUNNY SOUTH WHERE SHE HAD SPENT THE WINTER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0043 TUT TUT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0044 TUT TUT TUT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0045 EXCLAIMED JENNY AS SOON AS SHE SAW PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0046 IF HERE ISN'T PETER RABBIT HIMSELF
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0047 HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO KEEP OUT OF THE CLUTCHES OF REDDY FOX ALL THE LONG WINTER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0048 PETER CHUCKLED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0049 I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TROUBLE WITH REDDY DURING THE WINTER SAID HE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0050 BUT THIS VERY MORNING HE SO NEARLY CAUGHT ME THAT IT IS A WONDER THAT MY HAIR IS NOT SNOW WHITE FROM FRIGHT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0051 THEN HE TOLD JENNY ALL ABOUT HIS NARROW ESCAPE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0052 HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT HANDY HOLE OF GRANDFATHER CHUCK I COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ESCAPED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0053 CONCLUDED PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0054 JENNY WREN COCKED HER PERT LITTLE HEAD
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0055 ON ONE SIDE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0056 AND HER SHARP LITTLE EYES SNAPPED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0057 WHY DON'T YOU LEARN TO SWIM PETER LIKE YOUR COUSIN DOWN IN THE SUNNY SOUTH SHE DEMANDED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0058 IF HE HAD BEEN IN YOUR PLACE HE WOULD SIMPLY HAVE PLUNGED INTO THE SMILING POOL AND LAUGHED AT REDDY FOX
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0059 PETER SAT BOLT UPRIGHT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0061 VERY WIDE OPEN
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0062 IN THEM WAS A FUNNY LOOK OF SURPRISE AS HE STARED UP AT JENNY WREN
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0063 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT JENNY WREN HE DEMANDED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0064 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NONE OF THE RABBIT FAMILY SWIM UNLESS IT IS TO CROSS THE LAUGHING BROOK WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0065 OR WHEN ACTUALLY DRIVEN INTO THE WATER BY AN ENEMY FROM WHOM THERE IS NO OTHER ESCAPE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0066 I CAN SWIM A LITTLE IF I HAVE TO
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0067 BUT YOU DON'T CATCH ME IN THE WATER WHEN I CAN STAY ON LAND
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0068 WHAT IS MORE YOU WON'T FIND ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY DOING SUCH A THING
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0069 TUT TUT TUT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0070 TUT PETER EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN IN HER SHARP SCOLDING VOICE TUT TUT TUT TUT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0071 FOR A FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN SO CURIOUS ABOUT THE WAYS OF HIS FEATHERED NEIGHBORS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0072 YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0073 IF I WERE IN YOUR PLACE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0074 I WOULD LEARN A LITTLE ABOUT MY OWN RELATIVES BEFORE I BECAME CURIOUS ABOUT MY NEIGHBORS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0075 HOW MANY RELATIVES HAVE YOU PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0076 ONE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0077 REPLIED PETER PROMPTLY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0078 MY BIG COUSIN JUMPER THE HARE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0079 JENNY WREN THREW BACK HER HEAD AND LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND LAUGHED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0080 IT WAS A MOST IRRITATING AND PROVOKING LAUGH
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0081 FINALLY PETER BEGAN TO LOSE PATIENCE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0082 WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0083 HE DEMANDED CROSSLY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0084 YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT JUMPER THE HARE IS THE ONLY COUSIN I HAVE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0085 JENNY WREN LAUGHED HARDER THAT EVER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0086 PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0087 SHE GASPED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0088 PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0089 YOU WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0090 WHY DOWN IN THE SUNNY SOUTH WHERE I SPENT THE WINTER YOU HAVE A COUSIN WHO IS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO YOU THAN JUMPER THE HARE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0091 AND WHAT IS MORE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0092 HE IS ALMOST AS FOND OF THE WATER AS JERRY MUSKRAT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0093 HE WAS CALLED THE MARSH RABBIT OR MARSH HARE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0094 AND MANY A TIME I HAVE WATCHED HIM SWIMMING ABOUT BY THE HOUR
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0095 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0096 DECLARED PETER ANGRILY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0097 I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0098 YOU ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO FOOL ME JENNY WREN
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0099 THERE NEVER WAS A RABBIT AND THERE NEVER WILL BE A RABBIT WHO WOULD GO SWIMMING FOR THE FUN OF IT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0100 I BELONG TO THE COTTONTAIL BRANCH OF THE HARE FAMILY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0101 AND IT IS A FINE FAMILY IF I DO SAY SO
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0102 MY COUSIN JUMPER IS A TRUE HARE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0103 AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0104 IS THAT HE IS BIGGER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0105 HAS LONGER LEGS AND EARS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0106 CHANGES THE COLOR OF HIS COAT IN WINTER AND SELDOM IF EVER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0107 GOES INTO HOLES IN THE GROUND
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0108 THE IDEA OF TRYING TO TELL ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY OWN RELATIVES
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0109 JENNY WREN SUDDENLY BECAME SOBER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0110 PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0111 SAID SHE VERY EARNESTLY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0112 TAKE MY ADVICE AND GO TO SCHOOL TO OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR AWHILE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0113 WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU IS TRUE EVERY WORD OF IT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0114 YOU HAVE A COUSIN DOWN IN THE SUNNY SOUTH
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0115 WHO SPENDS HALF HIS TIME IN THE WATER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0116 WHAT IS MORE I SUSPECT THAT YOU AND JUMPER HAVE OTHER RELATIVES OF WHOM YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0117 SUCH IGNORANCE WOULD BE LAUGHABLE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0118 IF IT WERE NOT TO BE PITIED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0119 THIS IS WHAT COMES OF NEVER HAVING TRAVELED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0120 GO TO SCHOOL TO OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR A WHILE PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0121 IT WILL PAY YOU
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0122 WITH THIS JENNY WREN FLEW AWAY TO HUNT FOR MR WREN
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0123 THAT THEY MIGHT DECIDE WHERE TO MAKE THEIR HOME FOR THE SUMMER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0124 PETER TRIED TO BELIEVE WHAT JENNY WREN HAD TOLD HIM WAS NOTHING BUT A STORY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0125 BUT DO WHAT HE WOULD
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0126 HE COULDN'T RID HIMSELF OF A LITTLE DOUBT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0127 HE TRIED TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE OTHER LITTLE PEOPLE OF OLD ORCHARD BUT IT WAS USELESS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0128 THAT LITTLE DOUBT KEPT GROWING AND GROWING
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0129 COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT JENNY WREN HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0130 COULD IT BE THAT HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT RELATIVES HE HAD
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0131 OR ANYTHING ABOUT THEM
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0132 OF COURSE OLD MOTHER NATURE COULD TELL HIM ALL HE WANTED TO KNOW
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0133 AND HE KNEW THAT WHATEVER SHE MIGHT TELL HIM WOULD BE TRUE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0134 FINALLY THAT GROWING DOUBT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0135 TOGETHER WITH THE CURIOSITY WHICH HAS LED POOR PETER TO DO SO MANY QUEER THINGS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0136 PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0137 AND HE STARTED FOR THE GREEN FOREST TO LOOK FOR OLD MOTHER NATURE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0138 IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO FIND HER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0139 SHE WAS VERY BUSY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0140 FOR THERE IS NO TIME IN ALL THE YEAR WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE HAS QUITE SO MUCH TO DO
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0141 AS IN THE SPRING
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0142 IF YOU PLEASE OLD MOTHER NATURE SAID PETER TIMIDLY BUT VERY POLITELY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0143 I'VE SOME QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK YOU
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0144 OLD MOTHER NATURE'S EYES TWINKLED IN A KINDLY WAY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0145 ALL RIGHT PETER SHE REPLIED

ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0147 WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0148 I WANT TO KNOW IF IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE RABBIT AND THE HARE FAMILY BESIDES MY BIG COUSIN JUMPER

ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0150 AND MYSELF
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0151 OLD MOTHER NATURE'S EYES TWINKLED MORE THAN EVER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0152 WHY OF COURSE PETER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0153 SHE REPLIED THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER MEMBERS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0154 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0155 BUT THEN I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAVE TRAVELED
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0156 IT IS SURPRISING HOW LITTLE SOME FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THE VERY THINGS THEY OUGHT TO KNOW MOST ABOUT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0157 PETER LOOKED VERY HUMBLE
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0158 AND AS IF HE FELT A LITTLE BIT FOOLISH
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0159 IS

ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0167 THAN ANY OF YOUR OTHER COUSINS
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0168 PETER GULPED AS IF HE WERE SWALLOWING SOMETHING THAT WENT DOWN
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0169 THAT IS WHAT JENNY WREN SAID
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0170 BUT I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0171 REPLIED PETER MEEKLY
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0172 SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD OFTEN WATCHED HIM SWIMMING ABOUT LIKE JERRY MUSKRAT
ductapeguy-20070308b-bab.0173 OLD MOTHER NATURE NODDED

ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0005 OF AN ACQUISITORIAL PROPENSITY IN ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE OCCURRED THE CONQUEST OF IRELAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0006 ANCIENTLY CALLED HIBERNIA THESE PEOPLE WERE SIMILAR TO THE BRITONS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0007 BUT OF THEIR HISTORY PRIOR TO THE YEAR FOUR
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0008 HUNDRED A D LITTLE IS KNOWN BEFORE CHRIST
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0009 A RACE OF MEN INHABITED IRELAND HOWEVER
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0010 WHO HAD THEIR OWN LITERATURE AND WHO WERE ADVANCED IN THE ARTS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0011 THIS WAS BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EARLY MASS WHISKERS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0012 AND PRIOR TO THE DAYS WHEN THE ORANGEMEN HAD SENT FORTH THEIR DEFIANT PEAL
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0013 ILLUSTRATION EARLY MASS WHISKERS IN THE FIFTH CENTURY IRELAND WAS CONVERTED BY ST PATRICK
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0014 AND SHE BECAME KNOWN AS THE ISLAND OF SAINTS AND SCHOLARS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0015 TO SAY THAT SHE HAS BECOME THE ISLAND OF PUGILISTS AND POLICEMEN TO DAY WOULD BE UNJUST
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0016 AND TO SAY THAT SHE HAS MORE INFLUENCE IN AMERICA
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0017 THAN IN IRELAND WOULD BE UNKIND SURELY HER MODERN HISTORY IS MOST PATHETIC
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0018 FOR THREE CENTURIES THE ISLAND WAS HARASSED BY THE DANES AND NORTHMEN BUT
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0019 WHEN THE MARQUIS OF QUEENSBERRY RULES WERE ADOPTED
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0020 THE LATTER THREW UP THE SPONGE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0021 THE FINISH FIGHT OCCURRED AT CLONTARF NEAR DUBLIN
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0022 HENRY HAD WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE POPE TO CONQUER IRELAND YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE HE CARED TO DO IT
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0023 SOMETIMES IT RAINED AND AT OTHER TIMES HE DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0024 SO THAT HIS PERMISSION GOT ALMOST WORN OUT BY CARRYING IT ABOUT WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0025 IN ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO HOWEVER AN IRISH CHIEF
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0026 OR SUBORDINATE KING HAD TROUBLE WITH HIS KINGDOM
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0027 DOUBTLESS BECAUSE SOME RIVAL MONARCH STEPPED IN IT AND TRACKED IT AROUND OVER THE OTHER KINGDOMS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0028 AND SO HE CALLED UPON THE ANGLO NORMANS UNDER STRONGBOW
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0029 RICHARD DE CLARE WHOSE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0030 WAS THE FIRST THING OF THE KIND KNOWN TO CIVILIZATION FOR HELP
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0031 WHILE ASSISTING THE IRISH CHIEF STRONGBOW NOTICED A ROYAL WINK ON THE FEATURES OF HENRY
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0032 AND ACTING UPON IT PROCEEDED TO GATHER IN THE OTHER PRECINCTS OF IRELAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0033 THUS IN ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO THE ISLAND WAS PLACED UNDER THE RULE OF A VICEROY SENT THERE BY ENGLAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0034 HENRY NOW HAD TROUBLE WITH THREE OF HIS SONS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0035 HENRY RICHARD AND GEOFFREY WHO THREATENED THAT IF THE OLD GENTLEMAN DID NOT DIVIDE UP HIS KINGDOM AMONG THEM
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0036 THEY WOULD GO TO PARIS AND GO INTO THE ROUE BUSINESS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0037 HENRY HIMSELF WAS GREATLY TALKED ABOUT AND HIS NAME COUPLED WITH THAT OF FAIR ROSAMOND CLIFFORD
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0038 A RIVAL OF QUEEN ELEANOR THE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0039 KING REFUSED TO GRANT THE REQUEST OF HIS SONS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0040 AND BADE THEM GO AHEAD WITH THEIR ROUE ENTERPRISES
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0041 SO LONG AS THEY DID NOT ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0042 ILLUSTRATION THE BECKET DIFFICULTY STILL KEPT HENRY AWAKE AT NIGHT
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0043 SO THEY WENT TO PARIS WHERE THEIR CUTTINGS UP WERE NOT NOTICED
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0044 THE QUEEN TOOK THEIR SIDE AS ALSO DID LOUIS OF FRANCE AND WILLIAM KING OF SCOTLAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0045 WITH THE BECKET DIFFICULTY STILL KEEPING HIM AWAKE OF NIGHTS ALSO
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0046 THE KING WAS IN CONSTANT HOT WATER
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0047 AND FOR A TIME IT SEEMED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK OTHER EMPLOYMENT
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0048 BUT HIS MASTERLY HIT IN MAKING A BAREFOOTED PILGRIMAGE TO THE TOMB OF
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0049 BECKET THUS SECURING ABSOLUTION FROM THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY TURNED

ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0054 IRISH AND SCOTCH WHISKEY WERE NOW INTRODUCED INTO THE NATIONAL POLICY AND BITS OF BRIGHT ENGLISH HUMOR
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0055 WITH FOOT NOTES FOR THE USE OF THE SCOTS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0056 WERE SHIPPED TO EDINBURGH HENRY HAD MORE TROUBLE WITH HIS SONS HOWEVER
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0057 AND THEY EMBITTERED HIS LIFE AS THE SONS OF A TOO FROLICSOME FATHER ARE APT TO DO
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0058 HENRY JR DIED REPENTANT
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0059 BUT GEOFFREY PERISHED IN HIS SINS IN A TOURNAMENT ALTHOUGH GENERALLY THE TOURNAMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCIVE TO LONGEVITY
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0060 RICHARD WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY A REBEL AND AT LAST COMPELLED THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0061 YIELD TO A HUMILIATING TREATY WITH THE FRENCH IN ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0062 FINDING IN THE LIST OF THE OPPOSING FORCES THE NAME OF JOHN HIS YOUNG FAVORITE SON
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0063 THE POOR OLD BATTERED MONARCH IN ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE

ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0066 HE CURSED HIS SONS AND DIED MISERABLY DESERTED BY HIS FOLLOWERS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0067 WHO TOOK SUCH CLOTHING AS FITTED THEM BEST AND WOULD HAVE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0068 PAWNED THE THRONE HAD IT NOT BEEN OUT OF STYLE AND UNAVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0069 BESIDE BEING SECURED TO THE CASTLE

ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0078 HIS INAUGURAL BALL WERE INSULTED BY THE POPULACE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0079 WHO BELIEVED THAT THE KING FAVORED A MASSACRE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0080 AND SO MANY WERE PUT TO DEATH
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0081 RICHARD AND PHILIP OF FRANCE ORGANIZED A SUCCESSFUL CRUSADE AGAINST PEOPLE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0082 WHO WERE NOT DEEMED ORTHODOX AND SUCCEEDED IN BAGGING A GOOD MANY IN SYRIA
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0083 WHERE THE WOODS WERE FULL OF INFIDELS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0084 RICHARD HOWEVER WAS SO OVERBEARING THAT PHILIP COULD NOT GET ALONG WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0085 AND THEY DISSOLVED PARTNERSHIP BUT RICHARD CAPTURED ASCALON AFTER THIS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0086 HIS ARMY WAS TOO MUCH REDUCED HOWEVER TO CAPTURE JERUSALEM

ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0090 WE CAN ONLY SURMISE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0091 PEACE WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE PILGRIMS WHO DESIRED TO ENTER THE HOLY CITY

ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0093 ON HIS RETURN RICHARD WAS COMPELLED TO GO INCOG THROUGH GERMANY
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0094 AS THE AUTHORITIES WERE OPPOSED TO HIM
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0095 HE WAS DISCOVERED AND CONFINED TILL A LARGE RANSOM WAS PAID
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0096 PHILIP AND JOHN THE KING'S BROTHER DECIDED THAT RICHARD'S EXTREMITY WAS THEIR OPPORTUNITY
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0097 AND SO CONCLUDED TO DIVIDE UP HIS KINGDOM BETWEEN THEM
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0098 AT THIS DRAMATIC MOMENT RICHARD
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0099 HAVING PAID HIS SIXTY THOUSAND POUNDS RANSOM AND TIPPED HIS CUSTODIAN
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0100 ENTERED THE ENGLISH ARENA AND THE JIG WAS UP

ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0106 RECEIVED IN FRANCE AND WHEN BUT FORTY TWO YEARS OF AGE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0107 THE LONGEVITY AMONG MONARCHS OF THE PRESENT DAY IS INDEED GRATIFYING
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0108 WHEN ONE READS OF THE BRIEF LIVES OF THESE OLD REIGNERS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0109 FOR IT SURELY DEMONSTRATES THAT ROYALTY
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0110 WHEN NOT CARRIED TO EXCESS IS RATHER CONDUCIVE TO HEALTH THAN OTHERWISE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0111 RICHARD DIED FROM THE EFFECTS OF AN ARROW WOUND AND ALL HIS FOES IN THIS ENGAGEMENT WERE HANGED
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0112 EXCEPT THE YOUNG WARRIOR WHO HAD GIVEN HIM HIS DEATH WOUND
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0113 DOUBTLESS THIS WAS DONE TO ENCOURAGE GOOD MARKSMANSHIP
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0114 ENGLAND GOT NO BENEFIT FROM RICHARD'S GREAT DARING AND EXPENSIVE PICNICS IN PALESTINE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0115 BUT OF COURSE HE ADVERTISED GREAT BRITAIN AND FRIGHTENED FOREIGN POWERS CONSIDERABLY
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0116 THE TAXATION NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AN ARMY IN THE HOLY LAND WHERE BOARD WAS HIGH KEPT ENGLAND POOR
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0117 BUT EVERY ONE WAS PROUD OF RICHARD

ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0119 JOHN THE DISAGREEABLE BROTHER SUCCEEDED RICHARD AND REIGNED SEVENTEEN YEARS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0120 THOUGH HIS NEPHEW ARTHUR THE SON OF GEOFFREY WAS THE RIGHTFUL HEIR
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0121 PHILIP WHO KEPT HIMSELF IN POCKET MONEY BY STARTING ONE HORSE REBELLIONS AGAINST ENGLAND
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0122 JOINED WITH ARTHUR LONG ENOUGH TO EFFECT A TREATY IN TWELVE HUNDRED
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0123 WHICH KEPT HIM IN GROCERIES SEVERAL YEARS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0124 WHEN HE AGAIN BROUGHT PRINCE ARTHUR FORWARD BUT THIS WAS DISASTROUS
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0125 FOR THE YOUNG PRINCE WAS CAPTURED AND CRUELLY ASSASSINATED BY REQUEST OF HIS AFFECTIONATE UNCLE
ductapeguy-20070619-com-com0126 KING JOHN TO BE A RELATIVE OF THE KING IN THOSE

ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0006 MISS MIRANDA SAWYER'S OLD FASHIONED GARDEN WAS THE PLEASANTEST SPOT IN RIVERBORO ON A SUNNY JULY MORNING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0007 THE RICH COLOR OF THE BRICK HOUSE GLEAMED AND GLOWED THROUGH THE SHADE OF THE ELMS AND MAPLES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0008 LUXURIANT HOP VINES CLAMBERED UP THE LIGHTNING RODS AND WATER SPOUTS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0009 HANGING THEIR DELICATE CLUSTERS HERE AND THERE IN GRACEFUL PROFUSION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0010 WOODBINE TRANSFORMED THE OLD SHED AND TOOL HOUSE TO THINGS OF BEAUTY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0011 AND THE FLOWER BEDS THEMSELVES WERE THE PRETTIEST AND MOST FRAGRANT IN ALL THE COUNTRYSIDE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0012 A ROW OF DAHLIAS RAN DIRECTLY AROUND THE GARDEN SPOT DAHLIAS SCARLET GOLD AND VARIEGATED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0013 IN THE VERY CENTRE WAS A ROUND PLOT WHERE THE UPTURNED FACES OF A THOUSAND PANSIES SMILED AMID THEIR LEAVES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0014 AND IN THE FOUR CORNERS WERE TRIANGULAR BLOCKS OF SWEET PHLOX OVER WHICH THE BUTTERFLIES FLUTTERED UNCEASINGLY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0015 IN THE SPACES BETWEEN RAN A RIOT OF PORTULACA AND NASTURTIUMS WHILE IN THE MORE REGULAR SHELL BORDERED BEDS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0016 GREW SPIREA AND GILLYFLOWERS MIGNONETTE MARIGOLDS AND CLOVE PINKS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0017 BACK OF THE BARN AND ENCROACHING ON THE EDGE OF THE HAY FIELD WAS A GROVE OF SWEET CLOVER WHOSE WHITE FEATHERY TIPS FAIRLY BENT UNDER THE ASSAULTS OF THE BEES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0018 WHILE BANKS OF AROMATIC MINT AND THYME DRANK IN THE SUNSHINE AND SENT IT OUT AGAIN INTO THE SUMMER AIR
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0019 WARM AND DELICIOUSLY ODOROUS THE HOLLYHOCKS WERE MISS SAWYER'S PRIDE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0020 AND THEY GREW IN A STATELY LINE BENEATH THE FOUR KITCHEN WINDOWS THEIR TAPERING TIPS SET THICKLY WITH GAY SATIN CIRCLETS OF PINK OR LAVENDER OR CRIMSON
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0021 THEY GROW SOMETHING LIKE STEEPLES THOUGHT LITTLE REBECCA RANDALL WHO WAS WEEDING THE BED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0022 AND THE FLAT ROUND FLOWERS ARE LIKE ROSETTES BUT STEEPLES WOULDN'T BE STUDDED WITH ROSETTES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0023 SO IF YOU WERE WRITING ABOUT THEM IN A COMPOSITION YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE UP ONE OR THE OTHER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0024 AND I THINK I'LL GIVE UP THE STEEPLES GAY LITTLE HOLLYHOCK LIFTING YOUR HEAD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0025 SWEETLY ROSETTED OUT FROM YOUR BED IT'S A PITY THE HOLLYHOCK ISN'T REALLY LITTLE INSTEAD OF STEEPLING UP TO THE WINDOW TOP
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0026 BUT I CAN'T SAY GAY TALL HOLLYHOCK I MIGHT HAVE IT LINES TO A HOLLYHOCK IN MAY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0027 FOR THEN IT WOULD BE SMALL BUT OH NO I FORGOT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0028 IN MAY IT WOULDN'T BE BLOOMING AND IT'S SO PRETTY TO SAY THAT ITS HEAD IS SWEETLY ROSETTED

ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0033 MISS DEARBORN TOLD ME TO WRITE SOMETHING IN MY THOUGHT BOOK EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I'LL BEGIN THIS VERY NIGHT WHEN I GO TO BED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0034 REBECCA ROWENA RANDALL THE LITTLE NIECE OF THE BRICK HOUSE LADIES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0035 AND AT PRESENT SOJOURNING THERE FOR PURPOSES OF BOARD LODGING EDUCATION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0036 AND INCIDENTALLY SUCH DISCIPLINE AND CHASTENING AS MIGHT ULTIMATELY PRODUCE MORAL EXCELLENCE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0037 REBECCA RANDALL HAD A PASSION FOR THE RHYME AND RHYTHM OF POETRY FROM HER EARLIEST CHILDHOOD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0038 WORDS HAD ALWAYS BEEN TO HER WHAT DOLLS AND TOYS ARE TO OTHER CHILDREN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0039 AND NOW AT TWELVE SHE AMUSED HERSELF WITH PHRASES AND SENTENCES AND IMAGES AS HER SCHOOLMATES PLAYED WITH THE PIECES OF THEIR DISSECTED PUZZLES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0040 IF THE HEROINE OF A STORY TOOK A CURSORY GLANCE ABOUT HER APARTMENT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0041 REBECCA WOULD SHORTLY ASK HER AUNT JANE TO TAKE A CURSORY GLANCE AT HER OVERSEWING OR HEMMING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0042 IF THE VILLAIN AIDED AND ABETTED SOMEONE IN COMMITTING A CRIME
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0043 SHE WOULD BEFORE LONG REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF AIDING AND ABETTING IN DISHWASHING OR BEDMAKING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0044 SOMETIMES SHE USED THE BORROWED PHRASES UNCONSCIOUSLY SOMETIMES SHE BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CONVERSATION WITH AN INTENSE SENSE OF PLEASURE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0045 IN THEIR HARMONY OR APPROPRIATENESS FOR A BEAUTIFUL WORD OR SENTENCE HAD THE SAME EFFECT UPON HER IMAGINATION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0046 AS A FRAGRANT NOSEGAY A STRAIN OF MUSIC OR A BRILLIANT SUNSET
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0047 HOW ARE YOU GETTIN' ON REBECCA ROWENA CALLED A PEREMPTORY VOICE FROM WITHIN

ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0065 REBECCA WAS WEEDING THE HOLLYHOCK BED WHEN WONDERFUL THOUGHTS CAME INTO HER HEAD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0066 HER AUNT WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE ROLLING PIN AND THE THOUGHTS OF HER MIND WERE COMMON AND THIN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0067 THAT WOULDN'T DO BECAUSE IT'S MEAN TO AUNT MIRANDA AND ANYWAY IT ISN'T GOOD

ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0126 AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVED AND LONGED FOR AND MOURNED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0127 WE'VE DONE ALL WE CAN NOW WITHOUT A MINISTER WHISPERED REBECCA
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0128 WE COULD SING GOD IS EVER GOOD OUT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL SONG BOOK
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0129 BUT I'M AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD HEAR US AND THINK WE WERE GAY AND HAPPY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0130 WHAT'S THAT A STRANGE SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS A GURGLE A YAWN A MERRY LITTLE CALL
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0131 THE TWO GIRLS RAN IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT CAME AND THERE ON AN OLD COAT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0132 IN A CLUMP OF GOLDENROD BUSHES LAY A CHILD JUST WAKING FROM A REFRESHING NAP
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0133 IT'S THE OTHER BABY THAT LIZY ANN DENNETT TOLD ABOUT CRIED EMMA JANE ISN'T HE BEAUTIFUL
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0134 EXCLAIMED REBECCA COME STRAIGHT TO ME AND SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0135 THE CHILD STRUGGLED TO ITS FEET AND TOTTERED WAVERING TOWARD THE WARM WELCOME OF THE VOICE AND EYES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0136 REBECCA WAS ALL MOTHER AND HER MATERNAL INSTINCTS HAD BEEN WELL DEVELOPED IN THE LARGE FAMILY IN WHICH SHE WAS NEXT TO THE ELDEST
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0137 SHE HAD ALWAYS CONFESSED THAT THERE WERE PERHAPS A TRIFLE TOO MANY BABIES AT SUNNYBROOK FARM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0138 BUT NEVERTHELESS HAD SHE EVER HEARD IT SHE WOULD HAVE STOOD LOYALLY BY THE JAPANESE PROVERB
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0139 WHETHER BROUGHT FORTH UPON THE MOUNTAIN OR IN THE FIELD IT MATTERS NOTHING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0140 MORE THAN A TREASURE OF ONE THOUSAND RYO A BABY PRECIOUS IS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0141 YOU DARLING THING SHE CROONED AS SHE CAUGHT AND LIFTED THE CHILD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0142 YOU LOOK JUST LIKE A JACK O LANTERN THE BOY WAS CLAD IN A YELLOW COTTON DRESS VERY FULL AND
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0143 STIFF HIS HAIR WAS OF SUCH A BRIGHT GOLD AND SO SLEEK AND SHINY THAT HE LOOKED LIKE A
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0144 FAIR SMOOTH LITTLE PUMPKIN HE HAD WIDE BLUE EYES FULL OF LAUGHTER A NEAT LITTLE VERTICAL NOSE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0145 A NEAT LITTLE HORIZONTAL MOUTH WITH HIS FEW NEAT LITTLE TEETH SHOWING VERY PLAINLY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0146 AND ON THE WHOLE REBECCA'S FIGURE OF SPEECH WAS NOT SO WIDE OF THE MARK
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0147 OH EMMA JANE ISN'T HE TOO LOVELY TO GO TO THE POOR FARM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0148 IF ONLY WE WERE MARRIED WE COULD KEEP HIM AND SAY NOTHING AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0149 NOW THAT THE SIMPSONS HAVE GONE AWAY THERE ISN'T A SINGLE BABY IN RIVERBORO AND ONLY ONE IN EDGEWOOD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0150 IT'S A PERFECT SHAME BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0151 YOU REMEMBER AUNT MIRANDA WOULDN'T LET ME HAVE THE SIMPSON BABY WHEN I WANTED TO BORROW HER JUST FOR ONE RAINY SUNDAY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0152 MY MOTHER WON'T KEEP HIM SO IT'S NO USE TO ASK HER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0153 SHE SAYS MOST EVERY DAY SHE'S GLAD WE'RE GROWN UP AND SHE THANKS THE LORD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0154 THERE WASN'T BUT TWO OF US AND MRS PETER MESERVE IS TOO NERVOUS REBECCA WENT ON TAKING THE VILLAGE HOUSES IN TURN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0155 AND MRS ROBINSON IS TOO NEAT PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO LIKE ANY BUT THEIR OWN BABIES OBSERVED EMMA JANE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0156 WELL I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT REBECCA ANSWERED A BABY'S A BABY I SHOULD THINK
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0157 WHOSE EVER IT IS MISS DEARBORN IS COMING BACK MONDAY I WONDER IF SHE'D LIKE IT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0158 SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO OUT OF SCHOOL AND WE COULD BORROW IT ALL THE TIME
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0159 I DON'T THINK IT WOULD SEEM VERY GENTEEL FOR A YOUNG LADY LIKE MISS DEARBORN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0160 WHO BOARDS ROUND TO TAKE A BABY FROM PLACE TO PLACE OBJECTED EMMA JANE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0161 PERHAPS NOT AGREED REBECCA DESPONDENTLY BUT I THINK IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY ANY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0162 PRIVATE BABIES IN RIVERBORO WE OUGHT TO HAVE ONE FOR THE TOWN AND ALL HAVE A SHARE IN IT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0163 WE'VE GOT A TOWN HALL AND A TOWN LAMP POST AND A TOWN WATERING TROUGH
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0164 THINGS ARE SO UNEVEN ONE HOUSE LIKE MINE AT SUNNYBROOK BRIMFUL OF CHILDREN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0165 AND THE VERY NEXT ONE EMPTY THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THEM RIGHT WOULD BE TO LET ALL THE BABIES
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0166 THAT EVER ARE BELONG TO ALL THE GROWN UP PEOPLE THAT EVER ARE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0167 JUST DIVIDE THEM UP YOU KNOW IF THEY'D GO ROUND OH I HAVE A THOUGHT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0168 DON'T YOU BELIEVE AUNT SARAH COBB WOULD KEEP HIM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0169 SHE CARRIES FLOWERS TO THE GRAVEYARD EVERY LITTLE WHILE AND ONCE SHE TOOK ME WITH HER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0170 THERE'S A MARBLE CROSS AND IT SAYS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0171 SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF SARAH ELLEN BELOVED CHILD OF SARAH AND JEREMIAH COBB AGED SEVENTEEN MONTHS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0172 WHY THAT'S ANOTHER REASON MRS DENNETT SAYS THIS ONE IS SEVENTEEN MONTHS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0173 THERE'S FIVE OF US LEFT AT THE FARM WITHOUT ME
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0174 BUT IF WE WERE ONLY NEARER TO RIVERBORO HOW QUICK MOTHER WOULD LET IN ONE MORE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0175 WE MIGHT SEE WHAT FATHER THINKS AND THAT WOULD SETTLE IT SAID EMMA JANE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0176 FATHER DOESN'T THINK VERY SUDDEN BUT HE THINKS AWFUL STRONG
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0177 IF WE DON'T BOTHER HIM AND FIND A PLACE OURSELVES FOR THE BABY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0178 PERHAPS HE'LL BE WILLING HE'S COMING NOW I HEAR THE WHEELS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0179 LIZY ANN DENNETT VOLUNTEERED TO STAY AND PERFORM THE LAST RITES WITH THE UNDERTAKER AND JACK O LANTERN WITH HIS SLENDER WARDROBE TIED IN A BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEF
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0180 WAS LIFTED INTO THE WAGON BY THE RELUCTANT MR PERKINS AND JUBILANTLY HELD BY REBECCA IN HER LAP
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0181 MR PERKINS DROVE OFF AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0182 BEING HEARTILY SICK OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND THINKING WISELY THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS HAD ALREADY SEEN AND HEARD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THE SEAMY SIDE OF LIFE THAT MORNING
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0183 DISCUSSION CONCERNING JACK O LANTERN'S FUTURE WAS PRUDENTLY DEFERRED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0184 AND THEN MR PERKINS WAS MERCILESSLY PELTED WITH ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE CHOICE OF THE POOR FARM AS A PLACE OF RESIDENCE FOR A BABY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0185 HIS FATHER IS SURE TO COME BACK SOME TIME MR PERKINS URGED REBECCA
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0186 HE COULDN'T LEAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL THING FOREVER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0187 AND IF EMMA JANE AND I CAN PERSUADE MRS COBB TO KEEP HIM A LITTLE WHILE WOULD YOU CARE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0188 NO ON REFLECTION MR PERKINS DID NOT CARE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0189 HE MERELY WANTED A QUIET LIFE AND ENOUGH TIME LEFT OVER FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE TO ATTEND TO HIS BLACKSMITH'S SHOP
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0190 SO INSTEAD OF GOING HOME OVER THE SAME ROAD BY WHICH THEY CAME
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0191 HE CROSSED THE BRIDGE INTO EDGEWOOD AND DROPPED THE CHILDREN AT THE LONG LANE WHICH LED TO THE COBB HOUSE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0192 MRS COBB AUNT SARAH TO THE WHOLE VILLAGE SAT BY THE WINDOW LOOKING FOR UNCLE JERRY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0193 WHO WOULD SOON BE SEEN DRIVING THE NOON STAGE TO THE POST OFFICE OVER THE HILL
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0194 SHE ALWAYS HAD AN EYE OUT FOR REBECCA TOO
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0195 FOR EVER SINCE THE CHILD HAD BEEN A PASSENGER ON MR COBB'S STAGECOACH
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0196 MAKING THE EVENTFUL TRIP FROM HER HOME FARM TO THE BRICK HOUSE IN RIVERBORO IN HIS COMPANY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0197 SHE HAD BEEN A CONSTANT VISITOR AND THE JOY OF THE QUIET HOUSEHOLD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0198 EMMA JANE TOO WAS A WELL KNOWN FIGURE IN THE LANE BUT THE STRANGE BABY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0199 WAS IN THE NATURE OF A SURPRISE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0200 A SURPRISE SOMEWHAT MODIFIED BY THE FACT THAT REBECCA WAS A DRAMATIC PERSONAGE AND MORE LIABLE TO APPEAR IN CONJUNCTION WITH CURIOUS OUTRIDERS COMRADES AND RETAINERS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0201 THAN THE ORDINARY RIVERBORO CHILD SHE HAD RUN AWAY FROM THE TOO STERN DISCIPLINE OF THE BRICK HOUSE ON ONE OCCASION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0202 AND HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO RETURN BY UNCLE JERRY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0203 SHE HAD ESCORTED A WANDERING ORGAN GRINDER TO THEIR DOOR AND BEGGED A LODGING FOR HIM ON A RAINY NIGHT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0204 SO ON THE WHOLE THERE WAS NOTHING AMAZING ABOUT THE COMING PROCESSION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0205 THE LITTLE PARTY TOILED UP TO THE HOSPITABLE DOOR AND MRS COBB CAME OUT TO MEET THEM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0206 REBECCA WAS SPOKESMAN EMMA JANE'S TALENT DID NOT LIE IN ELOQUENT SPEECH
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0207 BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VALIANT AND A FLUENT CHILD INDEED
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0208 WHO COULD HAVE USURPED REBECCA'S PRIVILEGES AND TENDENCIES IN THIS DIRECTION
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0209 LANGUAGE BEING HER NATIVE ELEMENT AND WORDS OF ASSORTED SIZES SPRINGING SPONTANEOUSLY TO HER LIPS
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0210 AUNT SARAH DEAR SHE SAID PLUMPING JACK O LANTERN DOWN ON THE GRASS AS SHE PULLED HIS DRESS OVER HIS FEET AND SMOOTHED HIS HAIR BECOMINGLY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0211 WILL YOU PLEASE NOT SAY A WORD TILL I GET THROUGH AS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YOU SHOULD KNOW EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU ANSWER YES OR NO
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0212 THIS IS A BABY NAMED JACKY WINSLOW AND I THINK HE LOOKS LIKE A JACK O LANTERN
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0213 HIS MOTHER HAS JUST DIED OVER TO NORTH RIVERBORO ALL ALONE EXCEPTING FOR MRS LIZY
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0214 ANN DENNETT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0215 AND THERE WAS ANOTHER LITTLE WEENY BABY THAT DIED WITH HER AND EMMA JANE AND I PUT FLOWERS AROUND THEM AND DID THE BEST WE COULD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0216 THE FATHER THAT'S JOHN WINSLOW QUARRELED WITH THE MOTHER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0217 THAT WAS SAL PERRY ON THE MODERATION ROAD AND RAN AWAY AND LEFT HER
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0218 SO HE DOESN'T KNOW HIS WIFE AND THE WEENY BABY ARE DEAD
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0219 AND THE TOWN HAS GOT TO BURY THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND THE FATHER RIGHT OFF QUICK AND JACKY HAS GOT TO GO TO THE POOR FARM THIS AFTERNOON AND
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0220 IT SEEMS AN AWFUL SHAME TO TAKE HIM UP TO THAT LONESOME PLACE WITH THOSE OLD PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AMUSE HIM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0221 AND IF EMMA JANE AND ALICE ROBINSON AND I TAKE MOST ALL THE CARE OF HIM WE THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU AND UNCLE JERRY WOULD KEEP HIM JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0222 YOU'VE GOT A COW AND A TURN UP BEDSTEAD YOU KNOW SHE HURRIED ON INSINUATINGLY AND
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0223 THERE'S HARDLY ANY PLEASURE AS CHEAP AS MORE BABIES WHERE THERE'S EVER BEEN ANY BEFORE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0224 FOR BABY CARRIAGES AND TRUNDLE BEDS AND CRADLES DON'T WEAR OUT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0225 AND THERE'S ALWAYS CLOTHES LEFT OVER FROM THE OLD BABY TO BEGIN THE NEW ONE ON
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0226 OF COURSE WE CAN COLLECT ENOUGH THINGS TO START JACKY SO HE WON'T BE MUCH TROUBLE OR EXPENSE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0227 AND ANYWAY HE'S PAST THE MOST TROUBLESOME AGE AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO BE UP NIGHTS WITH HIM AND
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0228 HE ISN'T AFRAID OF ANYBODY OR ANYTHING AS YOU CAN SEE BY HIS JUST SITTING THERE LAUGHING AND SUCKING HIS THUMB
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0229 THOUGH HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF HIM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0230 AND HE'S JUST SEVENTEEN MONTHS OLD LIKE DEAR LITTLE SARAH ELLEN IN THE GRAVEYARD AND WE THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU THE REFUSAL OF HIM BEFORE HE GOES TO THE POOR FARM
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0231 AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0232 BECAUSE IT'S NEAR MY DINNER TIME AND AUNT MIRANDA WILL KEEP ME IN THE WHOLE AFTERNOON IF I'M LATE
ductapeguy-20080422-chr-chr0233 AND I'VE GOT TO FINISH WEEDING THE HOLLYHOCK BED BEFORE SUNDOWN

ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0004 GENESIS SIXTEEN ONE TO SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0005 YOU REMEMBER ABRAM'S WIFE WHO HAD JOURNEYED WITH HIM FROM UR OF THE CHALDEES AND WHO LIVED IN HIS TENT ALL THOSE YEARS WAS NAMED SARAI
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0006 NOW SARAI HAD A MAID A SERVANT THAT WAITED ON HER WHOSE NAME WAS HAGAR
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0007 SHE CAME FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT WHERE WERE THE PYRAMIDS AND THE TEMPLES
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0008 BUT SARAI AND HER MAID HAGAR HAD SOME TROUBLE
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0009 THEY COULD NOT AGREE AND SARAI WAS SO SHARP AND SEVERE WITH HAGAR
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0010 THAT AT LAST HAGAR RAN AWAY FROM SARAI'S TENT
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0011 SHE WENT OUT INTO THE DESERT AND TOOK THE ROAD THAT LED DOWN TO EGYPT HER OWN COUNTRY
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0012 THE LAND FROM WHICH SHE HAD COME ON THE WAY SHE STOPPED BESIDE A SPRING OF WATER
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0013 THERE AN ANGEL FROM THE LORD MET HER AND SAID TO HER HAGAR
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0014 ARE YOU NOT THE SERVANT OF SARAI ABRAM'S WIFE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0015 WHERE ARE YOU GOING AND HAGAR SAID TO THE ANGEL
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0016 I AM GOING AWAY FROM MY MISTRESS SARAI BECAUSE I DO NOT WISH TO STAY WITH HER AND SERVE HER ANY LONGER
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0017 THEN THE ANGEL SAID TO HAGAR GO BACK TO YOUR MISTRESS SARAI AND SUBMIT TO HER
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0018 FOR IT IS BETTER FOR YOU THAN TO GO AWAY
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0019 GOD KNOWS ALL YOUR TROUBLES FOR HE SEES YOU AND HEARS YOU AND HE WILL HELP YOU
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0020 BY AND BY YOU SHALL HAVE A SON AND YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME ISHMAEL BECAUSE
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0021 GOD HAS HEARD YOU THE WORD ISHMAEL MEANS GOD HEARS
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0022 SO WHENEVER HAGAR SHOULD SPEAK HER BOY'S NAME SHE WOULD THINK GOD HAS HEARD ME
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0023 THEN THE ANGEL TOLD HAGAR THAT HER SON ISHMAEL SHOULD BE STRONG AND FIERCE AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO OVERCOME HIM OR HIS CHILDREN
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0024 OR HIS DESCENDANTS THOSE WHO SHOULD COME AFTER HIM SO HAGAR WAS COMFORTED
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0025 AND WENT BACK AGAIN TO SERVE SARAI
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0026 AND AFTERWARD THE WELL WHERE SHE SAW THE ANGEL WAS CALLED BY A NAME WHICH MEANS
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0027 THE WELL OF THE LIVING ONE WHO SEES ME AND AFTER THIS HAGAR HAD A SON
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0028 AND AS THE ANGEL TOLD HER SHE CALLED HIS NAME ISHMAEL THAT IS GOD HEARS
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0029 WE SHALL READ MORE ABOUT HAGAR AND ISHMAEL A LITTLE LATER AFTER THIS
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0030 WHILE ABRAM WAS LIVING NEAR HEBRON THE LORD CAME TO HIM AGAIN AND SPOKE TO HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0031 WHILE ABRAM BOWED WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND GOD SAID I AM THE ALMIGHTY GOD
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0032 WALK BEFORE ME AND BE PERFECT AND I WILL MAKE YOU A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0033 AND YOUR NAME SHALL BE CHANGED YOU SHALL NO MORE BE CALLED ABRAM BUT ABRAHAM
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0034 A WORD THAT MEANS FATHER OF A MULTITUDE BECAUSE YOU SHALL BE THE FATHER OF MANY NATIONS OF PEOPLE
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0035 AND YOUR WIFE'S NAME SHALL ALSO BE CHANGED SHE SHALL NO MORE BE CALLED SARAI BUT SARAH
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0036 THAT IS PRINCESS AND YOU AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON AND YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME ISAAC
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0037 AND HE SHALL HAVE SONS WHEN HE BECOMES A MAN AND HIS DESCENDANTS
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0038 THOSE WHO SPRING FROM HIM SHALL BE VERY MANY PEOPLE
ductapeguy-20080423-ang-sto0039 SO FROM THIS TIME HE WAS NO LONGER ABRAM BUT ABRAHAM AND HIS WIFE WAS CALLED SARAH

ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0002 A CAPITAL SHIP FOR AN OCEAN TRIP WAS THE WALLOPING WINDOW BLIND
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0003 NO GALE THAT BLEW DISMAYED HER CREW OR TROUBLED THE CAPTAIN'S MIND
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0004 THE MAN AT THE WHEEL WAS TAUGHT TO FEEL CONTEMPT FOR THE WILDEST BLOW
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0005 AND IT OFTEN APPEARED WHEN THE WEATHER HAD CLEARED THAT HE'D BEEN IN HIS BUNK BELOW
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0006 THE BOATSWAIN'S MATE WAS VERY SEDATE YET FOND OF AMUSEMENT TOO
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0007 AND HE PLAYED HOP SCOTCH WITH THE STARBOARD WATCH WHILE THE CAPTAIN TICKLED THE CREW
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0008 AND THE GUNNER WE HAD WAS APPARENTLY MAD FOR HE SAT ON THE AFTER RAIL
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0009 AND FIRED SALUTES WITH THE CAPTAIN'S BOOTS IN THE TEETH OF THE BOOMING GALE
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT IN A COMMODORE'S HAT AND DINED IN A ROYAL WAY
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0011 ON TOASTED PIGS AND PICKLES AND FIGS AND GUMMERY BREAD EACH DAY
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0012 BUT THE COOK WAS DUTCH AND BEHAVED AS SUCH FOR THE FOOD THAT HE GAVE THE CREW
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0013 WAS A NUMBER OF TONS OF HOT CROSS BUNS CHOPPED UP WITH SUGAR AND GLUE
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0014 AND WE ALL FELT ILL AS MARINERS WILL ON A DIET THAT'S CHEAP AND RUDE
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0015 AND WE SHIVERED AND SHOOK AS WE DIPPED THE COOK IN A TUB OF HIS GLUESOME FOOD
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0016 THEN NAUTICAL PRIDE WE LAID ASIDE AND WE CAST THE VESSEL ASHORE
ductapeguy-20080423-nau-nau0017 ON THE GULLIBY ISLES WHERE THE POOHPOOH SMILES AND THE ANAGAZANDERS ROAR

ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0003 HURLBUT'S STORY OF THE BIBLE BY JESSE LYMAN HURLBUT PART THREE THE SHEPHERD BOY'S FIGHT WITH THE GIANT
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0004 FIRST SAMUEL SEVEN ONE TO FIFTY FOUR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0005 ALL THROUGH THE REIGN OF SAUL THERE WAS CONSTANT WAR WITH THE PHILISTINES WHO LIVED UPON THE LOWLANDS WEST OF ISRAEL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0006 AT ONE TIME WHEN DAVID WAS STILL WITH HIS SHEEP A FEW YEARS AFTER HE HAD BEEN ANOINTED BY SAMUEL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0007 THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES AND THE ISRAELITES WERE SET
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0008 AGAINST EACH OTHER ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE VALLEY OF ELAH READY TO FIGHT EACH OTHER
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0009 IN THE ARMY OF ISRAEL WERE THE THREE OLDEST BROTHERS OF DAVID WHO WERE SOLDIERS UNDER KING SAUL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0010 EVERY DAY A GIANT CAME OUT OF THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES AND DARED SOME ONE TO COME FROM THE ISRAELITES' CAMP AND FIGHT WITH HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0011 THE GIANT'S NAME WAS GOLIATH HE WAS NINE FEET HIGH AND HE WORE ARMOR FROM HEAD TO FOOT
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0012 AND CARRIED A SPEAR TWICE AS LONG AND AS HEAVY AS ANY OTHER MAN COULD HOLD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0013 AND HIS SHIELD BEARER WALKED BEFORE HIM HE CAME EVERY DAY AND CALLED OUT ACROSS THE LITTLE VALLEY
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0014 I AM A PHILISTINE AND YOU ARE SERVANTS OF SAUL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0015 NOW CHOOSE ONE OF YOUR MEN AND LET HIM COME OUT AND FIGHT WITH ME
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0016 IF I KILL HIM THEN YOU SHALL SUBMIT TO US AND IF HE KILLS ME
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0017 THEN WE WILL GIVE UP TO YOU COME NOW SEND OUT YOUR MAN
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0018 BUT NO MAN IN THE ARMY NOT EVEN KING SAUL DARED TO GO OUT AND FIGHT WITH THE GIANT
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0019 THE ISRAELITES WERE MOSTLY FARMERS AND SHEPHERDS AND WERE NOT FOND OF WAR AS WERE THE PHILISTINES
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0020 THEN TOO VERY FEW OF THE ISRAELITES HAD SWORDS AND SPEARS EXCEPT SUCH RUDE WEAPONS AS THEY COULD MAKE OUT OF THEIR FARMING TOOLS
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0021 FORTY DAYS THE CAMPS STOOD AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THE PHILISTINE GIANT CONTINUED HIS CALL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0022 ONE DAY OLD JESSE THE FATHER OF DAVID SENT DAVID FROM BETHLEHEM TO VISIT HIS THREE BROTHERS IN THE ARMY
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0023 DAVID CAME SPOKE TO HIS BROTHERS AND GAVE THEM A PRESENT FROM HIS FATHER
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0024 WHILE HE WAS TALKING WITH THEM GOLIATH THE GIANT CAME OUT AS BEFORE IN FRONT OF THE CAMP
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0025 CALLING FOR SOME ONE TO FIGHT WITH HIM THE ISRAELITES SAID TO ONE ANOTHER
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0026 IF ANY MAN WILL GO OUT AND KILL THIS PHILISTINE THE KING WILL GIVE HIM A GREAT REWARD AND A HIGH RANK
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0027 AND THE KINGS' DAUGHTER SHALL BE HIS WIFE AND DAVID SAID
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0028 WHO IS THIS MAN THAT SPEAKS IN THIS PROUD MANNER AGAINST THE ARMIES OF THE LIVING GOD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0029 WHY DOES NOT SOME ONE GO OUT AND KILL HIM DAVID'S BROTHER ELIAB SAID TO HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0030 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE LEAVING YOUR SHEEP IN THE FIELD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0031 I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE COME DOWN JUST TO SEE THE BATTLE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0032 BUT DAVID DID NOT CARE FOR HIS BROTHER'S ANGRY WORDS
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0033 HE WAS THINKING OUT SOME WAY TO KILL THIS BOASTING GIANT WHILE ALL THE MEN WERE IN TERROR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0034 THIS BOY THOUGHT OF A PLAN HE BELIEVED THAT HE KNEW HOW TO BRING DOWN THE BIG WARRIOR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0035 WITH ALL HIS ARMOR FINALLY DAVID SAID IF NO ONE ELSE WILL GO
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0036 I WILL GO OUT AND FIGHT WITH THIS ENEMY OF THE LORD'S PEOPLE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0037 THEY BROUGHT DAVID BEFORE KING SAUL SOME YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE SAUL HAD MET DAVID
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0038 AND HE HAD GROWN FROM A BOY TO A MAN
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0039 SO THAT SAUL DID NOT KNOW HIM AS THE SHEPHERD WHO HAD PLAYED ON THE HARP BEFORE HIM IN OTHER DAYS
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0040 SAUL SAID TO DAVID YOU CANNOT FIGHT WITH THIS GIANT YOU ARE VERY YOUNG AND HE IS A MAN OF WAR TRAINED FROM HIS YOUTH
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0041 AND DAVID ANSWERED KING SAUL I
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0042 AM ONLY A SHEPHERD BUT I HAVE FOUGHT WITH LIONS AND BEARS WHEN THEY HAVE TRIED TO STEAL MY SHEEP
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0043 AND I AM NOT AFRAID TO FIGHT WITH THIS PHILISTINE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0044 THE LORD SAVED ME FROM THE LION'S JAW AND THE BEAR'S PAW
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0045 AND HE WILL SAVE ME FROM THIS ENEMY FOR I SHALL FIGHT FOR THE LORD AND HIS PEOPLE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0046 THEN SAUL PUT HIS OWN ARMOR ON DAVID A HELMET ON HIS HEAD AND A COAT OF MAIL ON HIS BODY AND A SWORD AT HIS WAIST
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0047 BUT SAUL WAS ALMOST A GIANT AND HIS ARMOR WAS FAR TOO LARGE FOR DAVID
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0048 DAVID SAID I AM NOT USED TO FIGHTING WITH SUCH WEAPONS AS THESE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0049 LET ME FIGHT IN MY OWN WAY SO DAVID TOOK OFF SAUL'S ARMOR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0050 FOR DAVID'S PLAN TO FIGHT THE GIANT DID NOT NEED AN ARMOR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0051 BUT DID NEED A QUICK EYE A CLEAR HEAD A SURE AIM AND A BOLD HEART
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0052 AND ALL THESE DAVID HAD FOR GOD HAD GIVEN THEM TO HIM DAVID'S PLAN WAS VERY WISE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0053 IT WAS TO MAKE GOLIATH THINK THAT HIS ENEMY WAS TOO WEAK FOR HIM TO BE ON HIS GUARD AGAINST HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0054 AND WHILE SO FAR AWAY THAT THE GIANT COULD NOT REACH HIM WITH SWORD OR SPEAR TO STRIKE HIM DOWN WITH A WEAPON WHICH THE GIANT WOULD NOT EXPECT
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0055 AND WOULD NOT BE PREPARED FOR DAVID TOOK HIS SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0056 AS THOUGH THAT WERE TO BE HIS WEAPON
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0057 BUT OUT OF SIGHT IN A BAG UNDER HIS MANTLE HE HAD FIVE SMOOTH STONES CAREFULLY CHOSEN AND A SLING
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0058 THE WEAPON HE KNEW HOW TO USE THEN HE CAME OUT TO MEET THE PHILISTINE
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0059 THE GIANT LOOKED DOWN ON THE YOUTH AND DESPISED HIM AND LAUGHED AT HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0060 AM I A DOG HE SAID THAT THIS BOY COMES TO ME WITH A STAFF
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0061 I WILL GIVE HIS BODY TO THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0062 AND THE PHILISTINE CURSED DAVID BY THE GODS OF HIS PEOPLE AND DAVID ANSWERED HIM
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0063 YOU COME AGAINST ME WITH A SWORD AND A SPEAR AND A DART
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0064 BUT I COME TO YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF THE ARMIES OF ISRAEL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0065 THIS DAY WILL THE LORD GIVE YOU INTO MY HAND I WILL STRIKE YOU DOWN AND TAKE OFF YOUR HEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0066 AND THE HOST OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL BE DEAD BODIES TO BE EATEN BY THE BIRDS AND THE BEASTS
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0067 SO THAT ALL MAY KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOD IN ISRAEL
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0068 AND THAT HE CAN SAVE IN OTHER WAYS BESIDES WITH SWORD AND SPEAR
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0069 AND DAVID RAN TOWARD THE PHILISTINE AS IF TO FIGHT HIM WITH HIS SHEPHERD'S STAFF
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0070 BUT WHEN HE WAS JUST NEAR ENOUGH FOR A GOOD AIM HE TOOK OUT HIS SLING AND HURLED A STONE AIMED AT THE GIANT'S FOREHEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0071 DAVID'S AIM WAS GOOD THE STONE STRUCK THE PHILISTINE IN HIS FOREHEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0072 IT STUNNED HIM AND HE FELL TO THE GROUND
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0073 WHILE THE TWO ARMIES STOOD WONDERING AND SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT HAD CAUSED THE GIANT TO FALL SO SUDDENLY
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0074 DAVID RAN FORWARD DREW OUT THE GIANT'S OWN SWORD AND CUT OFF HIS HEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0075 THEN THE PHILISTINES KNEW THAT THEIR GREAT WARRIOR IN WHOM THEY TRUSTED WAS DEAD
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0076 THEY TURNED TO FLY BACK TO THEIR OWN LAND AND THE ISRAELITES FOLLOWED AFTER THEM AND KILLED THEM BY THE HUNDRED AND THOUSAND
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0077 EVEN TO THE GATES OF THEIR OWN CITY OF GATH
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0078 SO IN THAT DAY DAVID WON A GREAT VICTORY AND STOOD BEFORE ALL THE LAND AS THE ONE WHO HAD SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR ENEMIES
ductapeguy-20080423-sto-sto0079 END OF STORY NUMBER FIVE RECORDING BY SEAN MCGAUGHEY DUCT TAPE GUY DOT NET
dvg-20130110-xfs-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS

eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
eboyjr-20090725-brf-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
eboyjr-20090725-cye-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
eboyjr-20090725-cye-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
eboyjr-20090725-fov-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
eboyjr-20090725-hqr-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
eboyjr-20090725-mvs-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
eboyjr-20090725-nmh-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
eboyjr-20090725-nur-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0329 AH INDEED
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
eboyjr-20090725-ree-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
eboyjr-20090725-xrs-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
eboyjr-20090725-ywy-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
eddiea25-20090112-ybo-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
edman274-20090116-qws-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
edman274-20090116-qws-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
edman274-20090116-qws-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
edman274-20090116-qws-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
edman274-20090116-qws-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
edman274-20090116-qws-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
edman274-20090116-qws-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
edman274-20090116-qws-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
edman274-20090116-qws-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
edman274-20090116-qws-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
egmarin-20130716-drr-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
eloriane-20090901-lgx-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
eloriane-20090901-svr-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
elucify-20121208-chs-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
elucify-20121208-chs-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
elucify-20121208-chs-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
elucify-20121208-chs-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
elucify-20121208-chs-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
elucify-20121208-chs-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
elucify-20121208-chs-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
elucify-20121208-chs-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
elucify-20121208-chs-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
elucify-20121208-chs-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
erkki-20080616-qre-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
erkki-20080616-qre-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
erkki-20080616-qre-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
erkki-20080616-qre-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
erkki-20080616-qre-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
erkki-20080616-qre-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
erkki-20080616-qre-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
erkki-20080616-qre-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
erkki-20080616-qre-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
erkki-20080616-qre-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0357 CREEK REMAINED QUIET
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0360 CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
ethanoconnors-20080605-mpw-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0484 NO SIR EE
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
ethanoconnors-20080605-oiz-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
ethanoconnors-20080605-waa-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
ethanoconnors-20080607-guk-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
ethanoconnors-20080607-hyw-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
evaryont-20110718-buz-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
existania-20101005-csx-b0045 DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
existania-20101005-csx-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
existania-20101005-csx-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
existania-20101005-csx-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
existania-20101005-csx-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
existania-20101005-csx-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
existania-20101005-csx-b0051 DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
existania-20101005-csx-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
existania-20101005-csx-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
fangiotophia-20080604-smd-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
fate-20090311-osp-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
fate-20090311-osp-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
fate-20090311-osp-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
fate-20090311-osp-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
fate-20090311-osp-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
fate-20090311-osp-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
fate-20090311-osp-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
fate-20090311-osp-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
fate-20090311-osp-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
fate-20090311-osp-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
fate-20090311-urp-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
fate-20090311-urp-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
fate-20090311-urp-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
fate-20090311-urp-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
fate-20090311-urp-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
fate-20090311-urp-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
fate-20090311-urp-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
fate-20090311-urp-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
fate-20090311-urp-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
fate-20090311-urp-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
fatmav-20090703-jku-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
fenn-20100606-gwa-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
fenn-20100606-nyj-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
fenn-20100606-nyj-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL

fenn-20100606-nyj-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
fenn-20100606-nyj-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
fenn-20100606-nyj-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
fenn-20100606-nyj-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
fenn-20100606-nyj-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
fenn-20100606-nyj-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
fenn-20100606-nyj-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
fenn-20100606-pmr-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
fenn-20100606-rng-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
fenn-20100606-rng-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
fenn-20100606-rng-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
fenn-20100606-rng-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
fenn-20100606-rng-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
fenn-20100606-rng-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
fenn-20100606-rng-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
fenn-20100606-rng-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
fenn-20100606-rng-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
fenn-20100606-rng-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
fenn-20100606-sla-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
fenn-20100606-sla-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
fenn-20100606-sla-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
fenn-20100606-sla-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
fenn-20100606-sla-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
fenn-20100606-sla-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
fenn-20100606-sla-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
fenn-20100606-sla-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
fenn-20100606-sla-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
fenn-20100606-sla-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
fenn-20100606-xgq-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
fenn-20100606-xgq-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING

fenn-20100606-xgq-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
fenn-20100606-xgq-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
fenn-20100606-xgq-b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
fenn-20100606-yeu-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
fenn-20100606-yeu-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
fenn-20100606-yeu-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
fenn-20100606-yeu-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
fenn-20100606-yeu-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
fenn-20100606-yeu-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
fenn-20100606-yeu-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
fenn-20100606-yeu-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS

flagship172007-20130623-edu-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
flagship172007-20130623-edu-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
flagship172007-20130623-edu-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
flagship172007-20130623-edu-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
flagship172007-20130623-edu-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
flagship172007-20130623-nhi-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL

flagship172007-20130623-nhi-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
flagship172007-20130623-nhi-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
frankthetank-20141029-aoz-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
frankthetank-20141029-atc-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
frankthetank-20141029-atc-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
frankthetank-20141029-atc-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
frankthetank-20141029-atc-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
frankthetank-20141029-atc-a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
frankthetank-20141029-atc-a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
frankthetank-20141029-dbh-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
frankthetank-20141029-dyo-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
frankthetank-20141029-ikm-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
frankthetank-20141029-kxr-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
frankthetank-20141029-xka-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
frankthetank-20141029-xth-a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
frankthetank-20141029-xth-a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF

frankthetank-20141029-xth-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
frankthetank-20141029-xth-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
frankthetank-20141029-xth-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
frankthetank-20141029-xth-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT

frankx-20120105-gjo-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
frankx-20120105-gjo-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE

frankx-20120105-gjo-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
frankx-20120105-gjo-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
frankx-20120105-gjo-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
frankx-20120105-gjo-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
frankx-20120105-gjo-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
frankx-20120105-gjo-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK

frankx-20120105-qcy-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
frankx-20120105-qcy-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
frankx-20120105-qcy-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
frankx-20120105-qcy-a0329 AH INDEED
frankx-20120105-qcy-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
frankx-20120105-qcy-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
frankx-20120105-qcy-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
frankx-20120105-qcy-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
frankx-20120105-rmo-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
frankx-20120105-rmo-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
frankx-20120105-rmo-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
frankx-20120105-rmo-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
frankx-20120105-rmo-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
frankx-20120105-rmo-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
frankx-20120105-rmo-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER

frankx-20120105-yqs-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
frankx-20120105-yqs-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
frankx-20120105-yqs-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE

galalleni-20090316-wos-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
galalleni-20090316-wos-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
galalleni-20090316-wos-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF

gilevi74-20100507-hav-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
gilevi74-20100507-hav-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
gilevi74-20100507-hav-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
glasnost-20110202-ide-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY

glasnost-20110202-kds-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
glasnost-20110202-kds-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
glasnost-20110202-kds-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL

glasnost-20110202-mjh-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
glendat-20110921-epe-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
glendat-20110921-epe-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
glendat-20110921-epe-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
glendat-20110921-epe-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
glendat-20110921-epe-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
glendat-20110921-epe-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
glendat-20110921-epe-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
glendat-20110921-epe-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
glendat-20110921-epe-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
glendat-20110921-epe-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINY COILS
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
glendat-20110921-zhl-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
glenn-20080119-dgu-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
glenn-20080119-knq-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
glenn-20080119-knq-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
glenn-20080119-knq-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
glenn-20080119-knq-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
glenn-20080119-knq-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
glenn-20080119-knq-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
glenn-20080119-knq-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
glenn-20080119-knq-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
glenn-20080119-knq-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
glenn-20080119-knq-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
glenn-20080119-kvg-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
glenn-20080119-kvg-a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
glenn-20080119-kvg-a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
glenn-20080119-kvg-b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
glenn-20080119-kvg-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
glenn-20080119-kvg-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
glenn-20080119-kvg-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
glenn-20080119-kvg-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
glenn-20080119-kvg-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
glenn-20080119-kvg-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
glenn-20080119-uwj-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
glenn-20080119-wpe-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
glenn-20080119-ytb-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
godrik-20110526-lbc-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
godrik-20110526-lcl-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
gravity-20080309-bmr-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
gravity-20080309-box-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
gravity-20080309-box-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
gravity-20080309-box-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
gravity-20080309-box-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
gravity-20080309-box-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
gravity-20080309-box-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
gravity-20080309-box-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
gravity-20080309-box-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
gravity-20080309-box-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
gravity-20080309-box-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
gravity-20080309-mms-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
gravity-20080309-mms-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
gravity-20080309-mms-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
gravity-20080309-mms-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
gravity-20080309-mms-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
gravity-20080309-mms-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
gravity-20080309-mms-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
gravity-20080309-mms-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
gravity-20080309-mms-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
gravity-20080309-mms-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
gravity-20080309-vca-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
grill-20120728-myn-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
grill-20120728-myn-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
grill-20120728-myn-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
grill-20120728-myn-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
grill-20120728-myn-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
grill-20120728-myn-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
grill-20120728-myn-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
grill-20120728-myn-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
grill-20120728-myn-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
grill-20120728-myn-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
guilherme-20080123-pfh-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
gwg20130607-20130617-rol-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
h2oetry-20090510-nuj-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
halespawn-20090430-bft-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
halespawn-20090430-csk-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
halespawn-20090430-lzk-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER

hugh-20070606-bul-bul0005 NISUS AND SCYLLA MINOS KING OF CRETE MADE WAR UPON MEGARA
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0006 NISUS WAS KING OF MEGARA AND SCYLLA WAS HIS DAUGHTER
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0007 THE SIEGE HAD NOW LASTED SIX MONTHS AND THE CITY STILL HELD OUT FOR IT WAS DECREED BY FATE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0008 THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN SO LONG AS A CERTAIN PURPLE LOCK
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0009 WHICH GLITTERED AMONG THE HAIR OF KING NISUS REMAINED ON HIS HEAD
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0010 THERE WAS A TOWER ON THE CITY WALLS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0011 WHICH OVERLOOKED THE PLAIN WHERE MINOS AND HIS ARMY WERE ENCAMPED
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0012 TO THIS TOWER SCYLLA USED TO REPAIR
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0013 AND LOOK ABROAD OVER THE TENTS OF THE HOSTILE ARMY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0014 THE SIEGE HAD LASTED SO LONG THAT SHE HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH THE PERSONS OF THE LEADERS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0015 MINOS IN PARTICULAR EXCITED HER ADMIRATION
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0016 ARRAYED IN HIS HELMET AND BEARING HIS SHIELD SHE ADMIRED HIS GRACEFUL DEPORTMENT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0017 IF HE THREW HIS JAVELIN SKILL SEEMED COMBINED WITH FORCE IN THE DISCHARGE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0018 IF HE DREW HIS BOW APOLLO HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT MORE GRACEFULLY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0019 BUT WHEN HE LAID ASIDE HIS HELMET AND IN HIS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0020 PURPLE ROBES BESTRODE HIS WHITE HORSE WITH ITS GAY CAPARISONS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0021 AND REINED IN ITS FOAMING MOUTH
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0022 THE DAUGHTER OF NISUS WAS HARDLY MISTRESS OF HERSELF
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0023 SHE WAS ALMOST FRANTIC WITH ADMIRATION SHE ENVIED THE WEAPON THAT HE GRASPED
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0024 THE REINS THAT HE HELD
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0025 SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD IF IT WERE POSSIBLE GO TO HIM THROUGH THE HOSTILE RANKS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0026 SHE FELT AN IMPULSE TO CAST HERSELF DOWN FROM THE TOWER INTO THE MIDST OF HIS CAMP
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0027 OR TO OPEN THE GATES TO HIM
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0028 OR TO DO ANYTHING ELSE SO ONLY IT MIGHT GRATIFY MINOS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0029 AS SHE SAT IN THE TOWER SHE TALKED THUS WITH HERSELF
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0030 I KNOW NOT WHETHER TO REJOICE OR GRIEVE AT THIS SAD WAR
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0031 I GRIEVE THAT MINOS IS OUR ENEMY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0032 BUT I REJOICE AT ANY CAUSE THAT BRINGS HIM TO MY SIGHT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0033 PERHAPS HE WOULD BE WILLING TO GRANT US PEACE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0034 AND RECEIVE ME AS A HOSTAGE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0035 I WOULD FLY DOWN IF I COULD AND ALIGHT IN HIS CAMP AND TELL HIM THAT WE YIELD OURSELVES TO HIS MERCY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0036 BUT THEN TO BETRAY MY FATHER NO
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0037 RATHER WOULD I NEVER SEE MINOS AGAIN
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0038 AND YET NO DOUBT IT IS SOMETIMES THE BEST THING FOR A CITY TO BE CONQUERED
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0039 WHEN THE CONQUEROR IS CLEMENT AND GENEROUS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0040 MINOS CERTAINLY HAS RIGHT ON HIS SIDE I THINK WE SHALL BE CONQUERED
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0041 AND IF THAT MUST BE THE END OF IT WHY SHOULD NOT LOVE UNBAR THE GATES TO HIM INSTEAD OF LEAVING IT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0042 TO BE DONE BY WAR BETTER SPARE DELAY AND SLAUGHTER IF WE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0043 CAN AND O IF ANY ONE SHOULD WOUND OR KILL MINOS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0044 NO ONE SURELY WOULD HAVE THE HEART TO DO IT YET
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0045 IGNORANTLY NOT KNOWING HIM ONE MIGHT I WILL I WILL SURRENDER MYSELF TO HIM
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0046 WITH MY COUNTRY AS A DOWRY AND SO PUT AN END TO THE WAR
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0047 BUT HOW THE GATES ARE GUARDED AND MY FATHER KEEPS THE KEYS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0048 HE ONLY STANDS IN MY WAY O THAT IT MIGHT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0049 PLEASE THE GODS TO TAKE HIM AWAY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0050 BUT WHY ASK THE GODS TO DO IT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0051 ANOTHER WOMAN LOVING AS I DO WOULD
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0052 REMOVE WITH HER OWN HANDS WHATEVER STOOD IN THE WAY OF HER LOVE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0053 AND CAN ANY OTHER WOMAN DARE MORE THAN I
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0054 I WOULD ENCOUNTER FIRE AND SWORD TO GAIN MY OBJECT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0055 BUT HERE THERE IS NO NEED OF FIRE AND SWORD I
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0056 ONLY NEED MY FATHER'S PURPLE LOCK MORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD TO ME
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0057 THAT WILL GIVE ME ALL I WISH
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0058 WHILE SHE THUS REASONED NIGHT CAME ON
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0059 AND SOON THE WHOLE PALACE WAS BURIED IN SLEEP
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0060 SHE ENTERED HER FATHER'S BEDCHAMBER AND CUT OFF THE FATAL LOCK
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0061 THEN PASSED OUT OF THE CITY AND ENTERED THE ENEMY'S CAMP
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0062 SHE DEMANDED TO BE LED TO THE KING AND THUS ADDRESSED HIM
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0063 I AM SCYLLA THE DAUGHTER OF NISUS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0064 I SURRENDER TO YOU MY COUNTRY AND MY FATHER'S HOUSE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0065 I ASK NO REWARD BUT YOURSELF FOR LOVE OF YOU I HAVE DONE IT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0066 SEE HERE THE PURPLE LOCK WITH THIS I GIVE YOU MY FATHER AND HIS KINGDOM
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0067 SHE HELD OUT HER HAND WITH THE FATAL SPOIL
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0068 MINOS SHRUNK BACK AND REFUSED TO TOUCH IT THE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0069 GODS DESTROY THEE INFAMOUS WOMAN HE EXCLAIMED DISGRACE OF OUR TIME
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0070 MAY NEITHER EARTH NOR SEA YIELD THEE A RESTING PLACE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0071 SURELY MY CRETE WHERE JOVE HIMSELF WAS CRADLED SHALL NOT BE POLLUTED WITH SUCH A MONSTER
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0072 THUS HE SAID AND GAVE ORDERS THAT EQUITABLE TERMS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO THE CONQUERED CITY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0073 AND THAT THE FLEET SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SAIL FROM THE ISLAND
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0074 SCYLLA WAS FRANTIC UNGRATEFUL MAN SHE EXCLAIMED IS IT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0075 THUS YOU LEAVE ME ME WHO HAVE GIVEN YOU VICTORY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0076 WHO HAVE SACRIFICED FOR YOU PARENT AND COUNTRY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0077 I AM GUILTY I CONFESS AND DESERVE TO DIE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0078 BUT NOT BY YOUR HAND AS THE SHIPS LEFT THE SHORE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0079 SHE LEAPED INTO THE WATER AND SEIZING THE RUDDER OF THE ONE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0080 WHICH CARRIED MINOS SHE WAS BORNE ALONG AN UNWELCOME COMPANION OF THEIR COURSE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0081 A SEA EAGLE ING ALOFT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0082 IT WAS HER FATHER WHO HAD BEEN CHANGED INTO THAT FORM
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0083 SEEING HER POUNCED DOWN UPON HER AND STRUCK HER WITH HIS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0084 BEAK AND CLAWS IN TERROR SHE LET GO THE SHIP
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0085 AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE WATER BUT SOME PITYING DEITY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0086 CHANGED HER INTO A BIRD THE SEA EAGLE STILL CHERISHES THE OLD ANIMOSITY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0087 AND WHENEVER HE ESPIES HER IN HIS LOFTY FLIGHT YOU MAY SEE HIM DART DOWN UPON HER
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0088 WITH BEAK AND CLAWS TO TAKE VENGEANCE FOR THE ANCIENT CRIME
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0089 ECHO AND NARCISSUS ECHO WAS A BEAUTIFUL NYMPH FOND OF THE WOODS AND HILLS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0090 WHERE SHE DEVOTED HERSELF TO WOODLAND SPORTS SHE WAS A FAVORITE OF DIANA
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0091 AND ATTENDED HER IN THE CHASE BUT ECHO HAD ONE FAILING
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0092 SHE WAS FOND OF TALKING AND WHETHER IN CHAT OR ARGUMENT WOULD
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0093 HAVE THE LAST WORD ONE DAY JUNO WAS SEEKING HER HUSBAND WHO
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0094 SHE HAD REASON TO FEAR WAS AMUSING HIMSELF AMONG THE NYMPHS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0095 ECHO BY HER TALK CONTRIVED TO DETAIN THE GODDESS TILL THE NYMPHS MADE THEIR ESCAPE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0096 WHEN JUNO DISCOVERED IT SHE PASSED SENTENCE UPON ECHO IN THESE WORDS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0097 YOU SHALL FORFEIT THE USE OF THAT TONGUE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0098 WITH WHICH YOU HAVE CHEATED ME EXCEPT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0099 FOR THAT ONE PURPOSE YOU ARE SO FOND OF REPLY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0100 YOU SHALL STILL HAVE THE LAST WORD BUT NO POWER TO SPEAK FIRST
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0101 THIS NYMPH SAW NARCISSUS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0102 AS HE PURSUED THE CHASE UPON THE MOUNTAINS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0103 SHE LOVED HIM AND FOLLOWED HIS FOOTSTEPS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0104 O HOW SHE LONGED TO ADDRESS HIM IN THE SOFTEST ACCENTS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0105 AND WIN HIM TO CONVERSE BUT IT WAS NOT IN HER POWER
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0106 SHE WAITED WITH IMPATIENCE FOR HIM TO SPEAK FIRST
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0107 AND HAD HER ANSWER READY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0108 ONE DAY THE YOUTH BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS COMPANIONS SHOUTED ALOUD WHO'S HERE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0109 ECHO REPLIED HERE NARCISSUS LOOKED AROUND BUT SEEING NO ONE CALLED OUT COME
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0110 ECHO ANSWERED COME AS NO ONE CAME NARCISSUS CALLED AGAIN
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0111 WHY DO YOU SHUN ME ECHO ASKED THE SAME QUESTION
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0112 LET US JOIN ONE ANOTHER SAID THE YOUTH
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0113 THE MAID ANSWERED WITH ALL HER HEART IN THE SAME WORDS AND HASTENED TO THE SPOT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0114 READY TO THROW HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK HE STARTED BACK EXCLAIMING
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0115 HANDS OFF I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN YOU SHOULD HAVE ME
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0116 HAVE ME SAID SHE BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0117 HE LEFT HER AND SHE WENT TO HIDE HER BLUSHES
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0118 IN THE RECESSES OF THE WOODS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0119 FROM THAT TIME FORTH SHE LIVED IN CAVES AND AMONG MOUNTAIN CLIFFS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0120 HER FORM FADED WITH GRIEF TILL AT LAST ALL HER FLESH SHRANK AWAY
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0121 HER BONES WERE CHANGED INTO ROCKS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0122 AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT OF HER BUT HER VOICE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0123 WITH THAT SHE IS STILL READY TO REPLY TO ANY ONE WHO CALLS HER
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0124 AND KEEPS UP HER OLD HABIT OF HAVING THE LAST WORD
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0125 NARCISSUS'S CRUELTY IN THIS CASE WAS NOT THE ONLY INSTANCE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0126 HE SHUNNED ALL THE REST OF THE NYMPHS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0127 AS HE HAD DONE POOR ECHO
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0128 ONE DAY A MAIDEN WHO HAD IN VAIN ENDEAVORED TO ATTRACT HIM UTTERED A PRAYER THAT HE MIGHT
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0129 SOME TIME OR OTHER FEEL WHAT IT WAS TO LOVE AND MEET NO RETURN OF AFFECTION
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0130 THE AVENGING GODDESS HEARD AND GRANTED THE PRAYER THERE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0131 WAS A CLEAR FOUNTAIN WITH WATER LIKE SILVER TO WHICH THE SHEPHERDS NEVER DROVE THEIR FLOCKS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0132 NOR THE MOUNTAIN GOATS RESORTED NOR ANY OF THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0133 NEITHER WAS IT DEFACED WITH FALLEN LEAVES OR BRANCHES
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0134 BUT THE GRASS GREW FRESH AROUND IT AND THE ROCKS SHELTERED IT FROM THE SUN
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0135 HITHER CAME ONE DAY THE YOUTH FATIGUED WITH HUNTING
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0136 HEATED AND THIRSTY HE STOOPED DOWN TO DRINK
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0137 AND SAW HIS OWN IMAGE IN THE WATER
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0138 HE THOUGHT IT WAS SOME BEAUTIFUL WATER SPIRIT LIVING IN THE FOUNTAIN
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0139 HE STOOD GAZING WITH ADMIRATION AT THOSE
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0140 BRIGHT EYES THOSE LOCKS CURLED LIKE THE LOCKS OF BACCHUS OR APOLLO
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0141 THE ROUNDED CHEEKS THE IVORY NECK THE PARTED LIPS
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0142 AND THE GLOW OF HEALTH AND EXERCISE OVER ALL
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0143 HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF
hugh-20070606-bul-bul0144 HE BROUGHT HIS LIPS NEAR TO TAKE A KISS

ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
ilopezc-20060321-rainbow-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
imuntean-20100312-nmm-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
imuntean-20100312-nmm-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
imuntean-20100312-nmm-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
imuntean-20100312-nmm-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS

indy-20081103-pot-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
indy-20081103-pot-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
indy-20081103-pot-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
indy-20081103-pot-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
indy-20081103-pot-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
indy-20081103-pot-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF

indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
indymaynard-20090723-rig-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
isaiah-20131126-utk-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
isaiah-20131126-utk-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL

isaiah-20131126-utk-b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
isaiah-20131126-utk-b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
isaiah-20131126-utk-b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
isaiah-20131126-utk-b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
isaiah-20131126-utk-b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
isaiah-20131126-utk-b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
isilia-20120104-ttn-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
jade-20100109-bvy-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
jade-20100109-bvy-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
jade-20100109-bvy-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
jade-20100109-bvy-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
jade-20100109-bvy-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
jade-20100109-bvy-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
jade-20100109-bvy-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
jade-20100109-bvy-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
jade-20100109-bvy-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
jade-20100109-bvy-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
jade-20100109-eqe-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
jade-20100109-eqe-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
jade-20100109-eqe-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
jade-20100109-eqe-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
jade-20100109-eqe-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
jade-20100109-eqe-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
jade-20100109-eqe-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
jade-20100109-eqe-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
jade-20100109-eqe-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
jade-20100109-eqe-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
jade-20100109-gxb-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
jade-20100109-gxb-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
jade-20100109-gxb-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
jade-20100109-gxb-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
jade-20100109-gxb-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
jade-20100109-gxb-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
jade-20100109-gxb-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
jade-20100109-gxb-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
jade-20100109-gxb-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
jade-20100109-gxb-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
jade-20100109-how-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
jade-20100109-how-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
jade-20100109-how-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
jade-20100109-how-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
jade-20100109-how-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
jade-20100109-how-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
jade-20100109-how-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
jade-20100109-how-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
jade-20100109-how-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
jade-20100109-how-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
jade-20100109-qdo-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
jade-20100109-qdo-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
jade-20100109-qdo-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
jade-20100109-qdo-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
jade-20100109-qdo-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
jade-20100109-qdo-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
jade-20100109-qdo-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
jade-20100109-qdo-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
jade-20100109-qdo-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
jade-20100109-vpg-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
jade-20100109-vpg-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
jade-20100109-vpg-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
jade-20100109-vpg-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
jade-20100109-vpg-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
jade-20100109-vpg-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
jade-20100109-vpg-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
jade-20100109-vpg-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
jade-20100109-vpg-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
jade-20100109-vpg-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp001 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp002 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp003 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp004 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp005 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp006 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp007 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp008 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp009 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp010 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp011 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp012 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp013 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp014 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp015 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp016 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp017 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp018 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp019 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp020 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp021 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp022 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp023 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp024 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp025 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp026 SUPERIMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp027 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp028 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp029 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp030 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
jaiger-10212006-NR-rp031 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE

jaiger-10212006-rp031 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
jaiger-10272006-ar001 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
jaiger-10272006-ar002 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
jaiger-10272006-ar003 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
jaiger-10272006-ar004 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
jaiger-10272006-ar005 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
jaiger-10272006-ar006 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
jaiger-10272006-ar007 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
jaiger-10272006-ar008 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
jaiger-10272006-ar009 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
jaiger-10272006-ar010 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
jaiger-10272006-ar011 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
jaiger-10272006-ar012 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
jaiger-10272006-ar013 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
jaiger-10272006-ar014 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
jaiger-10272006-ar015 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
jaiger-10272006-ar016 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
jaiger-10272006-ar017 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
jaiger-10272006-ar018 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
jaiger-10272006-ar019 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
jaiger-10272006-ar020 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
jaiger-10272006-ar021 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
jaiger-10272006-ar022 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
jaiger-10272006-ar023 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
jaiger-10272006-ar024 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
jaiger-11052006-cc001 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
jaiger-11052006-cc002 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
jaiger-11052006-cc003 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
jaiger-11052006-cc004 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
jaiger-11052006-cc005 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
jaiger-11052006-cc006 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
jaiger-11052006-cc007 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
jaiger-11052006-cc008 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
jaiger-11052006-cc009 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
jaiger-11052006-cc010 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
jaiger-11052006-cc011 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
jaiger-11052006-cc012 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
jaiger-11052006-cc013 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
jaiger-11052006-cc014 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
jaiger-11052006-cc015 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
jaiger-11052006-cc016 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
jaiger-11052006-cc017 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
jaiger-11052006-cc018 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
jaiger-11052006-cc019 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
jaiger-11052006-cc020 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
jaiger-11052006-cc021 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
jaiger-11052006-cc022 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
jaiger-11052006-cc023 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
jaiger-11052006-cc024 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
jaiger-11052006-cc025 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
jaiger-11052006-cc026 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
jaiger-11052006-cc027 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
jaiger-11052006-cc028 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
jaiger-11052006-cc029 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
jaiger-11052006-cc030 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
jaiger-11052006-cc031 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
jaiger-11052006-cc032 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER
jaiger-11052006-cc033 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
jaiger-11052006-cc034 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

jaiger-11282006-vf01-11 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
jaiger-11282006-vf01-12 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
jaiger-11282006-vf01-13 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
jaiger-11282006-vf01-14 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
jaiger-11282006-vf01-15 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
jaiger-11282006-vf01-16 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
jaiger-11282006-vf01-17 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
jaiger-11282006-vf01-18 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
jaiger-11282006-vf01-19 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
jaiger-11282006-vf01-20 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
jaiger-11282006-vf01-21 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
jaiger-11282006-vf01-22 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
jaiger-11282006-vf01-23 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
jaiger-11282006-vf01-24 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
jaiger-11282006-vf01-25 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
jaiger-11282006-vf01-26 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
jaiger-11282006-vf01-27 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
jaiger-11282006-vf01-28 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
jaiger-11282006-vf01-29 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
jaiger-11282006-vf01-30 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
jaiger-11282006-vf01-31 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
jaiger-11282006-vf01-32 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
jaiger-11282006-vf01-33 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
jaiger-11282006-vf01-34 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
jaiger-11282006-vf01-35 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
jaiger-11282006-vf01-36 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
jaiger-11282006-vf01-37 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
jaiger-11282006-vf01-38 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
jaiger-11282006-vf01-39 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
jaiger-11282006-vf01-40 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
jaiger-11282006-vf02-01 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
jaiger-11282006-vf02-02 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
jaiger-11282006-vf02-03 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
jaiger-11282006-vf02-04 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
jaiger-11282006-vf02-05 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
jaiger-11282006-vf02-06 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
jaiger-11282006-vf02-07 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
jaiger-11282006-vf02-08 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
jaiger-11282006-vf02-09 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
jaiger-11282006-vf02-10 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
jaiger-11282006-vf02-11 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
jaiger-11282006-vf02-12 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
jaiger-11282006-vf02-13 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
jaiger-11282006-vf02-14 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
jaiger-11282006-vf02-15 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
jaiger-11282006-vf02-16 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
jaiger-11282006-vf02-17 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
jaiger-11282006-vf02-18 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
jaiger-11282006-vf02-19 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
jaiger-11282006-vf02-20 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
jaiger-11282006-vf02-21 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
jaiger-11282006-vf02-22 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
jaiger-11282006-vf02-23 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
jaiger-11282006-vf02-24 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
jaiger-11282006-vf02-25 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
jaiger-11282006-vf02-26 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
jaiger-11282006-vf02-27 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
jaiger-11282006-vf02-28 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
jaiger-11282006-vf02-29 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
jaiger-11282006-vf02-30 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
jaiger-11282006-vf02-31 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
jaiger-11282006-vf02-32 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
jaiger-11282006-vf02-33 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
jaiger-11282006-vf02-34 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
jaiger-11282006-vf02-35 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
jaiger-11282006-vf02-36 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
jaiger-11282006-vf02-37 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
jaiger-11282006-vf02-38 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
jaiger-11282006-vf02-39 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
jaiger-11282006-vf02-40 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-01 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-02 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-03 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-04 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-05 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-06 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-07 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-08 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-10 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-11 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-12 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-13 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-14 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-15 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-16 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-17 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-18 SHALL I CARRY YOU
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-19 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-20 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-21 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-22 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-23 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-24 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-25 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-26 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-27 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-28 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-30 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-31 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-32 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-33 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-35 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-38 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
jaiger-12032006-3-vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-01 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-02 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-03 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-04 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-05 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-06 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-07 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-08 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-09 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-10 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-11 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-13 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-14 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-15 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-16 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-18 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-19 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-20 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-21 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-22 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-23 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-24 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-25 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-26 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-27 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-28 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-29 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-30 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-31 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-32 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-33 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-34 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-35 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-36 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-37 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-38 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-39 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
jaiger-12032006-4-vf4-40 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-01 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-02 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-03 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-04 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-05 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-06 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-07 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-08 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-09 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-11 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-12 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-13 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-14 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-19 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-20 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-21 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-23 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-24 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-29 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-36 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-37 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-38 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-39 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
jaiger-12032006-5-vf5-40 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-01 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-02 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-03 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-04 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-05 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-06 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-07 HOW MUCH WAS IT
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-08 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-09 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-10 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-11 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-12 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-13 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-14 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-15 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-16 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-17 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-18 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-19 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-20 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-21 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-22 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-23 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-24 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-25 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-26 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-27 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-28 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-29 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-30 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-31 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-32 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-33 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-34 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-35 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-36 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-37 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-38 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-39 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
jaiger-12032006-6-vf6-40 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-01 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-02 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-03 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-04 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-05 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-06 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF PRINCESS NAOMI
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-07 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-08 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-09 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-10 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-11 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-12 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-13 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-14 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-15 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT

jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-25 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-26 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-27 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW

jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-30 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-31 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-32 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-33 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-34 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-35 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-36 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-37 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-38 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-39 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
jaiger-20061231-vf7-vf7-40 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES

jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-02 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-03 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-04 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-05 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-06 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-07 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-08 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-09 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-10 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-11 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-12 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-13 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-14 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-15 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-16 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-17 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-18 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-19 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-20 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-21 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-22 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-23 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-24 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-25 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-26 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-27 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-28 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-29 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-30 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-31 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-32 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-33 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-34 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-35 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-36 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-37 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-38 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-39 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
jaiger-20061231-vf8-vf8-40 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-01 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-02 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-03 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-04 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-05 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-06 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-07 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-08 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-09 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-10 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-11 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-12 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-13 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-14 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-15 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-16 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-17 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-18 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-19 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-20 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-21 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-22 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-23 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-24 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-25 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-26 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-27 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-28 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-29 MAB SHE SAID
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-30 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-31 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-32 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-33 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-34 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-35 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-36 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-37 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-38 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-39 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
jaiger-20070103-vf10-vf10-40 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-01 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-02 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-03 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-04 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-05 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-06 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-07 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-08 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-09 AH INDEED
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-10 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-11 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-12 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-13 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-14 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-15 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-16 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-17 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-18 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-19 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-20 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-21 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-22 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-23 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-24 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-25 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-26 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-27 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-28 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-29 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-30 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-31 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-32 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-33 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-34 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-35 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-36 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-37 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-38 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-39 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
jaiger-20070103-vf9-vf9-40 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-01 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-02 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-03 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-04 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-05 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-06 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-07 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-08 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-09 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-10 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-11 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-12 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-13 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-14 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-15 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-16 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-17 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-18 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-19 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-20 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-21 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-22 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-23 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-24 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-25 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-26 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-27 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-28 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-29 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-30 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-31 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-32 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-33 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-34 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-35 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-36 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
jaiger-20070209-vf11-vf11-37 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL

jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-02 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-03 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-04 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-05 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-06 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT

jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-09 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-10 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-11 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-12 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-13 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-14 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-15 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-16 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-17 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-18 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-19 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-20 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-21 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-22 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-23 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-24 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-25 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-26 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-27 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-28 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-29 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-30 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-31 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-32 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-33 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-34 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-35 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-36 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-37 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-38 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-39 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
jaiger-20070209-vf12-vf12-40 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-01 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-02 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-03 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-04 NO SIR EE
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-05 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-06 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-07 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-08 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-09 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-10 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-11 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-12 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-13 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-14 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-15 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-16 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-17 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-18 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-19 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-20 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-21 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-22 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-23 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-24 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-25 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-26 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-27 IN SHORT MY JOYOUS INDIVIDUALISM WAS DOMINATED BY THE ORTHODOX BOURGEOIS ETHICS
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-28 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-29 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-30 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-31 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-32 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-33 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-34 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-35 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-36 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-37 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-38 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-39 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
jaiger-20070209-vf13-vf13-40 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-01 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-02 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-03 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-04 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-05 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-06 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-07 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-08 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-09 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-10 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-11 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-12 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-13 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-14 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-15 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-16 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-17 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-18 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-19 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-20 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-21 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-22 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-23 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-24 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-25 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-26 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-27 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-28 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-30 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-31 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-32 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-33 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-34 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-35 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-36 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-37 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-38 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-39 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
jaiger-20070209-vf14-vf14-40 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-01 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-02 WHAT THE FLAMING
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-03 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-04 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-05 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-06 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-07 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-08 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-09 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-10 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-11 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-12 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-13 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-14 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-15 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-16 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-17 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-18 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-19 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-20 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-21 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-22 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-23 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-24 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-25 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-26 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-27 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-28 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-29 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-30 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-31 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-32 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-33 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-34 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-35 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-36 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-37 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-38 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-39 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
jaiger-20070209-vf15-vf15-40 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-01 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-02 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-03 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-04 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-05 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-06 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-07 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-08 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-09 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-10 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-11 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-12 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-13 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-14 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-15 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-16 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-17 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-18 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-19 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-20 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-21 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-22 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-23 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-24 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-25 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-26 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-27 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-28 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-29 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-30 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-31 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-32 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-33 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-34 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-35 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-36 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-37 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-38 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-39 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
jaiger-vf16-20070214-vf16-40 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-01 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-02 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-03 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-04 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-05 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-06 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-07 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-08 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-09 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-10 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-11 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-12 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-13 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-14 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-15 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-16 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-17 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-18 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-19 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-20 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-21 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-22 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-23 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-24 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-25 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-26 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-27 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-28 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-29 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-30 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-31 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-32 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-33 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-34 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-35 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-36 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-37 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-38 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-39 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
jaiger-vf17-20070214-vf17-40 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-01 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-02 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-03 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-04 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-05 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-06 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-07 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-08 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-09 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-10 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-11 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-12 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-13 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-14 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-15 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-16 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-17 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-18 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-19 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-20 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-21 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-22 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-23 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-24 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-25 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-26 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-27 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-28 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE

jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-31 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-32 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-33 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-34 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-35 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-36 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-37 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-38 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-39 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
jaiger-vf18-20070214-vf18-40 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-01 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-02 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-03 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-04 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-05 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-06 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-07 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-08 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-09 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-10 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-11 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-12 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-13 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME

jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-15 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-16 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-17 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-18 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-19 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-20 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-21 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-22 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-23 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-24 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-25 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-26 FAST BUT ENDURE
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-27 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-28 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-29 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-30 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-31 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-32 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-33 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
jaiger-vf19-20070220-vf19-34 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING

jaiger-vf20-20070220-vf20-08 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
jaiger-vf20-20070220-vf20-09 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
jaiger-vf20-20070220-vf20-10 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
jaiger-vf20-20070220-vf20-11 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS

jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0138 WAS FORCED INTO HIS MOUTH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0139 HE RECOVERED HIS SENSES BUT HE WAS EVIDENTLY IN A SITUATION OF EXTREME DANGER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0140 THE QUEEN WAS FOR A TIME ASSIDUOUS IN HER ATTENDANCE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0141 THE DUKE OF YORK SCARCELY LEFT HIS BROTHER'S BEDSIDE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0142 THE PRIMATE AND FOUR OTHER BISHOPS WERE THEN IN LONDON

jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0144 AND TOOK IT BY TURNS TO SIT UP AT NIGHT IN THE KING'S ROOM
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0145 THE NEWS OF HIS ILLNESS FILLED THE CAPITAL WITH SORROW AND DISMAY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0146 FOR HIS EASY TEMPER AND AFFABLE MANNERS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0147 HAD WON THE AFFECTION OF A LARGE PART OF THE NATION
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0148 AND THOSE WHO MOST DISLIKED HIM PREFERRED HIS UNPRINCIPLED LEVITY TO THE STERN AND EARNEST BIGOTRY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0149 OF HIS BROTHER ON THE MORNING OF THURSDAY THE FIFTH OF FEBRUARY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0150 THE LONDON GAZETTE ANNOUNCED THAT HIS MAJESTY WAS GOING ON WELL
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0151 AND WAS THOUGHT BY THE PHYSICIANS TO BE OUT OF DANGER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0152 THE BELLS OF ALL THE CHURCHES RANG MERRILY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0153 AND PREPARATIONS FOR BONFIRES WERE MADE IN THE STREETS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0154 BUT IN THE EVENING IT WAS KNOWN THAT A RELAPSE HAD TAKEN PLACE AND
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0155 THAT THE MEDICAL ATTENDANTS HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0156 THE PUBLIC MIND WAS GREATLY DISTURBED
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0157 BUT THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION TO TUMULT THE DUKE OF YORK
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0158 WHO HAD ALREADY TAKEN ON HIMSELF TO GIVE ORDERS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0159 ASCERTAINED THAT THE CITY WAS PERFECTLY QUIET
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0160 AND THAT HE MIGHT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BE PROCLAIMED AS SOON
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0161 AS HIS BROTHER SHOULD EXPIRE THE KING WAS IN GREAT PAIN
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0162 AND COMPLAINED THAT HE FELT AS IF A FIRE WAS BURNING WITHIN HIM
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0163 YET HE BORE UP AGAINST HIS SUFFERINGS WITH A FORTITUDE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0164 WHICH DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO HIS SOFT AND LUXURIOUS NATURE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0165 THE SIGHT OF HIS MISERY AFFECTED HIS WIFE SO MUCH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0166 THAT SHE FAINTED AND WAS CARRIED SENSELESS TO HER CHAMBER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0167 THE PRELATES WHO WERE IN WAITING HAD FROM THE FIRST
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0168 EXHORTED HIM TO PREPARE FOR HIS END
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0169 THEY NOW THOUGHT IT THEIR DUTY TO ADDRESS HIM
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0170 IN A STILL MORE URGENT MANNER WILLIAM SANCROFT ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0171 AN HONEST AND PIOUS THOUGH NARROWMINDED MAN USED GREAT FREEDOM
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0172 IT IS TIME HE SAID TO SPEAK OUT FOR SIR
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0173 YOU ARE ABOUT TO APPEAR BEFORE A JUDGE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0174 WHO IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS THE KING ANSWERED NOT A WORD
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0175 THOMAS KEN BISHOP OF BATH AND WELLS THEN TRIED HIS POWERS OF PERSUASION
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0176 HE WAS A MAN OF PARTS AND LEARNING OF QUICK SENSIBILITY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0177 AND STAINLESS VIRTUE HIS ELABORATE WORKS HAVE LONG BEEN FORGOTTEN
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0178 BUT HIS MORNING AND EVENING HYMNS ARE STILL REPEATED DAILY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0179 IN THOUSANDS OF DWELLINGS THOUGH LIKE MOST OF HIS ORDER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0180 ZEALOUS FOR MONARCHY HE WAS NO SYCOPHANT BEFORE HE BECAME A BISHOP
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0181 HE HAD MAINTAINED THE HONOUR OF HIS GOWN BY REFUSING
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0182 WHEN THE COURT WAS AT WINCHESTER TO LET ELEANOR GWYNN
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0183 LODGE IN THE HOUSE WHICH HE OCCUPIED THERE AS A PREBENDARY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0184 THE KING HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO RESPECT SO MANLY A SPIRIT
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0185 OF ALL THE PRELATES HE LIKED KEN THE BEST
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0186 IT WAS TO NO PURPOSE HOWEVER THAT THE GOOD BISHOP
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0187 NOW PUT FORTH ALL HIS ELOQUENCE HIS SOLEMN AND PATHETIC EXHORTATION
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0188 AWED AND MELTED THE BYSTANDERS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0189 TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT SOME AMONG THEM BELIEVED HIM TO BE FILLED WITH THE SAME SPIRIT
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0190 WHICH IN THE OLD TIME HAD BY THE MOUTHS OF NATHAN AND ELIAS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0191 CALLED SINFUL PRINCES TO REPENTANCE CHARLES HOWEVER WAS UNMOVED
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0192 HE MADE NO OBJECTION INDEED WHEN THE SERVICE FOR THE VISITATION OF THE SICK WAS READ
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0193 IN REPLY TO THE PRESSING QUESTIONS OF THE DIVINES
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0194 HE SAID THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE AMISS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0195 AND HE SUFFERED THE ABSOLUTION TO BE PRONOUNCED OVER HIM
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0196 ACCORDING TO THE FORMS OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND BUT
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0197 WHEN HE WAS URGED TO DECLARE THAT HE DIED IN THE COMMUNION OF THAT CHURCH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0198 HE SEEMED NOT TO HEAR WHAT WAS SAID
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0199 AND NOTHING COULD INDUCE HIM TO TAKE THE EUCHARIST
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0200 FROM THE HANDS OF THE BISHOPS A
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0201 TABLE WITH BREAD AND WINE WAS BROUGHT TO HIS BEDSIDE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0202 BUT IN VAIN SOMETIMES
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0203 HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO HURRY AND SOMETIMES THAT HE WAS TOO WEAK
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0204 MANY ATTRIBUTED THIS APATHY TO CONTEMPT FOR DIVINE THINGS AND MANY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0205 TO THE STUPOR WHICH OFTEN PRECEDES DEATH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0206 BUT THERE WERE IN THE PALACE A FEW PERSONS WHO KNEW BETTER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0207 CHARLES HAD NEVER BEEN A SINCERE MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0208 HIS MIND HAD LONG OSCILLATED BETWEEN HOBBISM AND POPERY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0209 WHEN HIS HEALTH WAS GOOD AND HIS SPIRITS HIGH HE WAS A SCOFFER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0210 IN HIS FEW SERIOUS MOMENTS HE WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC THE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0211 DUKE OF YORK WAS AWARE OF THIS BUT WAS ENTIRELY OCCUPIED
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0212 WITH THE CARE OF HIS OWN INTERESTS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0213 HE HAD ORDERED THE OUTPORTS TO BE CLOSED HE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0214 HAD POSTED DETACHMENTS OF THE GUARDS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY HE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0215 HAD ALSO PROCURED THE FEEBLE SIGNATURE OF THE DYING KING
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0216 TO AN INSTRUMENT BY WHICH SOME DUTIES
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0217 GRANTED ONLY TILL THE DEMISE OF THE CROWN
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0218 WERE LET TO FARM FOR A TERM OF THREE YEARS
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0219 THESE THINGS OCCUPIED THE ATTENTION OF JAMES TO SUCH A DEGREE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0220 THAT THOUGH ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS HE WAS INDISCREETLY AND UNSEASONABLY EAGER
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0221 TO BRING OVER PROSELYTES TO HIS CHURCH
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0222 HE NEVER REFLECTED THAT HIS BROTHER WAS IN DANGER OF DYING
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0223 WITHOUT THE LAST SACRAMENTS THIS NEGLECT WAS THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0224 BECAUSE THE DUCHESS OF YORK HAD AT THE REQUEST OF THE QUEEN
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0225 SUGGESTED ON THE MORNING ON WHICH THE KING WAS TAKEN ILL
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0226 THE PROPRIETY OF PROCURING SPIRITUAL ASSISTANCE FOR SUCH ASSISTANCE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0227 CHARLES WAS AT LAST INDEBTED TO AN AGENCY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0228 OF HIS PIOUS WIFE AND SISTER IN LAW A LIFE OF FRIVOLTY AND VICE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0229 HAD NOT EXTINGUISHED IN THE DUCHESS OF PORTSMOUTH ALL SENTIMENTS OF RELIGION
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0230 OR ALL THAT KINDNESS WHICH IS THE GLORY OF HER SEX
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0231 THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR BARILLON WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0232 TO ENQUIRE AFTER THE KING PAID HER A VISIT
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0233 HE FOUND HER IN AN AGONY OF SORROW
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0234 SHE TOOK HIM INTO A SECRET ROOM
jimmowatt-20070308-hoe-hoe0235 AND POURED OUT HER WHOLE HEART TO HIM
jippen-20090218-his-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
jippen-20090218-his-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
jippen-20090218-his-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
jippen-20090218-his-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
jippen-20090218-his-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
jippen-20090218-his-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
jippen-20090218-his-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
jippen-20090218-his-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
jippen-20090218-his-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
jippen-20090218-his-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0537 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
jkramlich-20100305-ahn-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
jkramlich-20100305-kng-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0416 OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
jkramlich-20100305-krg-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
jkramlich-20100305-tmv-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
jkramlich-20100305-yee-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
jlrice9673-20090622-nop-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
jlrice9673-20090622-rxy-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
jlrice9673-20090623-agu-a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
jlrice9673-20090623-dfl-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
jlrice9673-20090625-len-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
jlrice9673-20090625-xai-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
jo-20090106-bbq-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
jo-20090106-bbq-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
jo-20090106-bbq-a0329 AH INDEED
jo-20090106-bbq-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
jo-20090106-bbq-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
jo-20090106-bbq-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
jo-20090106-bbq-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
jo-20090106-bbq-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
jo-20090106-bbq-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
jo-20090106-bbq-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
joehms22-20131229-axy-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
joehms22-20131229-bjq-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
joehms22-20131229-dtf-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
joehms22-20131229-dtf-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
joehms22-20131229-dtf-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
joehms22-20131229-dtf-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
joehms22-20131229-dtf-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED

joehms22-20131229-kra-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
joehms22-20131229-kra-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
joehms22-20131229-kra-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
joehms22-20131229-kra-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
joehms22-20131229-kra-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
joehms22-20131229-kra-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
joehms22-20131229-kra-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
joehms22-20131229-kra-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
joehms22-20131229-tul-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
joehms22-20131229-yha-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE

joel-20091111-pgd-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS
joel-20091111-pgd-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
joel-20091111-pgd-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
joel-20091111-pgd-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
joel-20091112-aaq-a0378 BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
joel-20091112-aaq-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
joel-20091112-aaq-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
joel-20091112-aaq-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
joel-20091112-aaq-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
joel-20091112-aaq-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
joel-20091112-aaq-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
joel-20091112-aaq-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
joel-20091112-aaq-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
joel-20091112-cdp-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
joel-20091112-cdp-b0301 A FLYING ARROW PASSED BETWEEN US
joel-20091112-cdp-b0302 I PULLED SUDDENLY WITH ALL MY MIGHT
joel-20091112-cdp-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
joel-20091112-cdp-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
joel-20091112-cdp-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
joel-20091112-cdp-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
joel-20091112-cdp-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME
joel-20091112-cdp-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
joel-20091112-hmo-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY

joel-20091112-vwo-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
joel-20091112-vwo-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
joel-20091112-vwo-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
joel-20091112-vwo-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
joel-20091112-vwo-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD

joel-20091112-xuc-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
joel-20091112-xuc-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
joel-20091112-xuc-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
joel-20091112-xuc-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
joel-20091112-xuc-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
joel-20091112-xuc-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
joel-20091112-xuc-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
joel-20091112-xuc-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
joel-20091112-xuc-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
joel-20091112-zbl-b0533 POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
joel-20091112-zbl-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
joel-20091112-zbl-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
joel-20091112-zbl-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
joel-20091112-zbl-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
joel-20091112-zbl-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
joel-20091112-zbl-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
joel-20091112-zbl-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
joel-20091112-zbl-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
joel-20091112-zbl-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
joel-20091116-aqq-b0315 THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
joel-20091116-aqq-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
joel-20091116-aqq-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
joel-20091116-aqq-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
joel-20091116-aqq-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
joel-20091116-aqq-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
joel-20091116-aqq-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
joel-20091116-aqq-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
joel-20091116-aqq-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
joel-20091116-ehr-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
joel-20091116-ehr-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
joel-20091116-ehr-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
joel-20091116-ehr-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
joel-20091116-ehr-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
joel-20091116-ehr-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
joel-20091116-ehr-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
joel-20091116-ehr-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
joel-20091116-ehr-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
joel-20091116-gpo-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
joel-20091116-gpo-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
joel-20091116-gpo-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
joel-20091116-gpo-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
joel-20091116-gpo-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
joel-20091116-gpo-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
joel-20091116-gpo-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
joel-20091116-gpo-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
joel-20091116-gpo-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
joel-20091116-gpo-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
joel-20091116-hih-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
joel-20091116-hih-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
joel-20091116-hih-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
joel-20091116-hih-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
joel-20091116-hih-rp-26 POSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
joel-20091116-hih-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
joel-20091116-hih-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
joel-20091116-hih-rp-30 COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
joel-20091116-hih-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
joel-20091116-onv-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
joel-20091116-onv-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
joel-20091116-onv-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
joel-20091116-onv-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
joel-20091116-onv-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
joel-20091116-onv-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
joel-20091116-onv-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED IN
joel-20091116-onv-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
joel-20091116-onv-b0501 WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
joel-20091116-uin-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
joel-20091116-uin-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
joel-20091116-uin-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
joel-20091116-uin-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED
joel-20091116-uin-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
joel-20091116-uin-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
joel-20091116-uin-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
joel-20091116-uin-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
joel-20091116-uin-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
joel-20091116-uin-a0251 I MAY MANAGE
joel-20091206-dem-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
joel-20091206-dem-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
joel-20091206-dem-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
joel-20091206-dem-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
joel-20091206-dem-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
joel-20091206-dem-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
joel-20091206-dem-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
joel-20091206-dem-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
joel-20091206-dem-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
joel-20091206-dem-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
joel-20110310-chd-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
joel-20110310-chd-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
joel-20110310-chd-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
joel-20110310-chd-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
joel-20110310-chd-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
joel-20110310-chd-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
joel-20110310-chd-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
joel-20110310-chd-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
joel-20110310-chd-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
joel-20110310-chd-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
joel-20110310-kcq-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
joel-20110310-kcq-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
joel-20110310-kcq-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
joel-20110310-kcq-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
joel-20110310-kcq-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
joel-20110310-kcq-a0006 GOD BLESS EM I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
joel-20110310-kcq-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
joel-20110310-kcq-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
joel-20110310-kcq-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
joel-20110310-kcq-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
joel-20110310-rsn-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
joel-20110310-rsn-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
joel-20110310-rsn-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
joel-20110310-rsn-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
joel-20110310-rsn-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
joel-20110310-rsn-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
joel-20110310-rsn-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
joel-20110310-rsn-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
joel-20110310-rsn-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
joel-20110310-rsn-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
joel-20110310-sjc-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
joel-20110310-sjc-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
joel-20110310-sjc-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
joel-20110310-sjc-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
joel-20110310-sjc-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
joel-20110310-sjc-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
joel-20110310-sjc-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
joel-20110310-sjc-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
joel-20110310-sjc-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
joel-20110310-sjc-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
joel4039-20091223-oqi-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP

jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
jorje_villafan-20090905-bzk-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR

jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR

jorje_villafan-20090905-fmm-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE

jpaugh-20130304-fua-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
jpaugh-20130304-fua-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
jpaugh-20130304-fua-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
jpaugh-20130304-fua-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
jpaugh-20130304-fua-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY

jtmiles-20090618-uad-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
jtmiles-20090618-uad-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
jtmiles-20090618-uad-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
jtmiles-20090618-uad-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
jtmiles-20090618-zga-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
jtmiles-20090618-zga-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST

jyuter-20130227-dfe-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE

kadoban-20120417-ldw-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
kadoban-20120417-ldw-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
kadoban-20120417-ldw-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT

kadoban-20120417-ydj-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
kadoban-20120417-ydj-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
kadoban-20120417-ydj-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
kadoban-20120417-ydj-b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
kadoban-20120417-ydj-b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
kadoban-20120417-ydj-b0400 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
kadoban-20120417-ydj-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
kaeles-20090413-jva-b0348 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
kaeles-20090413-mtv-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
kalljo-20120308-els-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
kalljo-20120308-els-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
kalljo-20120308-els-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
kalljo-20120308-els-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
kalljo-20120308-els-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
kalljo-20120308-els-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
kalljo-20120308-els-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
kalljo-20120308-els-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
kalljo-20120308-els-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
katalia369-20150719-cqj-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP

kayray-20070425-per04-per0004 THIS READING BY KARA SHALLENBERG PERSUASION BY JANE AUSTEN CHAPTER FOUR
kayray-20070425-per04-per0005 HE WAS NOT MR WENTWORTH THE FORMER CURATE OF MONKFORD
kayray-20070425-per04-per0006 HOWEVER SUSPICIOUS APPEARANCES MAY BE BUT A CAPTAIN FREDERICK WENTWORTH HIS BROTHER WHO
kayray-20070425-per04-per0007 BEING MADE COMMANDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTION OFF ST DOMINGO
kayray-20070425-per04-per0008 AND NOT IMMEDIATELY EMPLOYED HAD COME INTO SOMERSETSHIRE IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN OH SIX
kayray-20070425-per04-per0009 AND HAVING NO PARENT LIVING FOUND A HOME FOR HALF A YEAR AT MONKFORD
kayray-20070425-per04-per0010 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A REMARKABLY FINE YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04-per0011 WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE SPIRIT AND BRILLIANCY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0012 AND ANNE AN EXTREMELY PRETTY GIRL WITH GENTLENESS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0013 MODESTY TASTE AND FEELING
kayray-20070425-per04-per0014 HALF THE SUM OF ATTRACTION ON EITHER SIDE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0015 FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO DO AND SHE HAD HARDLY ANYBODY TO LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0016 BUT THE ENCOUNTER OF SUCH LAVISH RECOMMENDATIONS COULD NOT FAIL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0017 THEY WERE GRADUALLY ACQUAINTED AND WHEN ACQUAINTED RAPIDLY AND DEEPLY IN LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0018 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH HAD SEEN HIGHEST PERFECTION IN THE OTHER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0019 OR WHICH HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST SHE IN RECEIVING HIS DECLARATIONS AND PROPOSALS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0020 OR HE IN HAVING THEM ACCEPTED A SHORT PERIOD OF EXQUISITE FELICITY FOLLOWED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0021 AND BUT A SHORT ONE TROUBLES SOON AROSE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0022 SIR WALTER ON BEING APPLIED TO WITHOUT ACTUALLY WITHHOLDING HIS CONSENT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0023 OR SAYING IT SHOULD NEVER BE GAVE IT ALL THE NEGATIVE OF GREAT ASTONISHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0024 GREAT COLDNESS GREAT SILENCE AND A PROFESSED RESOLUTION OF DOING NOTHING FOR HIS DAUGHTER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0025 HE THOUGHT IT A VERY DEGRADING ALLIANCE AND LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0026 THOUGH WITH MORE TEMPERED AND PARDONABLE PRIDE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0027 RECEIVED IT AS A MOST UNFORTUNATE ONE ANNE ELLIOT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0028 WITH ALL HER CLAIMS OF BIRTH BEAUTY AND MIND
kayray-20070425-per04-per0029 TO THROW HERSELF AWAY AT NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04-per0030 INVOLVE HERSELF AT NINETEEN IN AN ENGAGEMENT WITH A YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04-per0031 WHO HAD NOTHING BUT HIMSELF TO RECOMMEND HIM
kayray-20070425-per04-per0032 AND NO HOPES OF ATTAINING AFFLUENCE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0033 BUT IN THE CHANCES OF A MOST UNCERTAIN PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04-per0034 AND NO CONNEXIONS TO SECURE EVEN HIS FARTHER RISE IN THE PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04-per0035 WOULD BE INDEED A THROWING AWAY WHICH SHE GRIEVED TO THINK OF
kayray-20070425-per04-per0036 ANNE ELLIOT SO YOUNG
kayray-20070425-per04-per0037 KNOWN TO SO FEW TO BE SNATCHED OFF BY A STRANGER WITHOUT ALLIANCE OR FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0038 OR RATHER SUNK BY HIM INTO A STATE OF MOST WEARING ANXIOUS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0039 YOUTH KILLING DEPENDENCE IT MUST NOT BE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0040 IF BY ANY FAIR INTERFERENCE OF FRIENDSHIP
kayray-20070425-per04-per0041 ANY REPRESENTATIONS FROM ONE WHO HAD ALMOST A MOTHER'S LOVE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0042 AND MOTHER'S RIGHTS IT WOULD BE PREVENTED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NO FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0043 HE HAD BEEN LUCKY IN HIS PROFESSION
kayray-20070425-per04-per0044 BUT SPENDING FREELY WHAT HAD COME FREELY HAD REALIZED NOTHING
kayray-20070425-per04-per0045 BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SOON BE RICH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0046 FULL OF LIFE AND ARDOUR HE KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SOON HAVE A SHIP
kayray-20070425-per04-per0047 AND SOON BE ON A STATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO EVERYTHING HE WANTED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0048 HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN LUCKY HE KNEW HE SHOULD BE SO STILL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0049 SUCH CONFIDENCE POWERFUL IN ITS OWN WARMTH AND BEWITCHING
kayray-20070425-per04-per0050 IN THE WIT WHICH OFTEN EXPRESSED IT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0051 MUST HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR ANNE BUT LADY RUSSELL SAW IT VERY DIFFERENTLY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0052 HIS SANGUINE TEMPER AND FEARLESSNESS OF MIND OPERATED VERY DIFFERENTLY ON HER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0053 SHE SAW IN IT BUT AN AGGRAVATION OF THE EVIL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0054 IT ONLY ADDED A DANGEROUS CHARACTER TO HIMSELF HE WAS BRILLIANT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0055 HE WAS HEADSTRONG LADY RUSSELL HAD LITTLE TASTE FOR WIT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0056 AND OF ANYTHING APPROACHING TO IMPRUDENCE A HORROR
kayray-20070425-per04-per0057 SHE DEPRECATED THE CONNEXION IN EVERY LIGHT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0058 SUCH OPPOSITION AS THESE FEELINGS PRODUCED WAS MORE THAN ANNE COULD COMBAT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0059 YOUNG AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0060 IT MIGHT YET HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO WITHSTAND HER FATHER'S ILL WILL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0061 THOUGH UNSOFTENED BY ONE KIND WORD OR LOOK ON THE PART OF HER SISTER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0062 BUT LADY RUSSELL WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND RELIED ON COULD NOT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0063 WITH SUCH STEADINESS OF OPINION AND SUCH TENDERNESS OF MANNER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0064 BE CONTINUALLY ADVISING HER IN VAIN
kayray-20070425-per04-per0065 SHE WAS PERSUADED TO BELIEVE THE ENGAGEMENT A WRONG THING
kayray-20070425-per04-per0066 INDISCREET IMPROPER HARDLY CAPABLE OF SUCCESS AND NOT DESERVING IT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0067 BUT IT WAS NOT A MERELY SELFISH CAUTION UNDER WHICH SHE ACTED IN PUTTING AN END TO IT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0068 HAD SHE NOT IMAGINED HERSELF CONSULTING HIS GOOD
kayray-20070425-per04-per0069 EVEN MORE THAN HER OWN SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM UP
kayray-20070425-per04-per0070 THE BELIEF OF BEING PRUDENT AND SELF DENYING
kayray-20070425-per04-per0071 PRINCIPALLY FOR HIS ADVANTAGE WAS HER CHIEF CONSOLATION
kayray-20070425-per04-per0072 UNDER THE MISERY OF A PARTING A FINAL PARTING
kayray-20070425-per04-per0073 AND EVERY CONSOLATION WAS REQUIRED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0074 FOR SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER ALL THE ADDITIONAL PAIN OF OPINIONS ON HIS SIDE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0075 TOTALLY UNCONVINCED AND UNBENDING AND OF HIS FEELING HIMSELF ILL USED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0076 BY SO FORCED A RELINQUISHMENT HE HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY IN CONSEQUENCE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0077 A FEW MONTHS HAD SEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0078 BUT NOT WITH A FEW MONTHS ENDED ANNE'S SHARE OF SUFFERING FROM IT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0079 HER ATTACHMENT AND REGRETS HAD FOR A LONG TIME
kayray-20070425-per04-per0080 CLOUDED EVERY ENJOYMENT OF YOUTH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0081 AND AN EARLY LOSS OF BLOOM AND SPIRITS HAD BEEN THEIR LASTING EFFECT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0082 MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WERE GONE SINCE THIS LITTLE HISTORY OF SORROWFUL INTEREST HAD REACHED ITS CLOSE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0083 AND TIME HAD SOFTENED DOWN MUCH PERHAPS NEARLY ALL OF PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HIM
kayray-20070425-per04-per0084 BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOO DEPENDENT ON TIME ALONE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0085 NO AID HAD BEEN GIVEN IN CHANGE OF PLACE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0086 EXCEPT IN ONE VISIT TO BATH SOON AFTER THE RUPTURE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0087 OR IN ANY NOVELTY OR ENLARGEMENT OF SOCIETY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0088 NO ONE HAD EVER COME WITHIN THE KELLYNCH CIRCLE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0089 WHO COULD BEAR A COMPARISON WITH FREDERICK WENTWORTH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0090 AS HE STOOD IN HER MEMORY NO SECOND ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0091 THE ONLY THOROUGHLY NATURAL HAPPY AND SUFFICIENT CURE AT HER TIME OF LIFE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0092 HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO THE NICE TONE OF HER MIND
kayray-20070425-per04-per0093 THE FASTIDIOUSNESS OF HER TASTE IN THE SMALL LIMITS OF THE SOCIETY AROUND THEM
kayray-20070425-per04-per0094 SHE HAD BEEN SOLICITED WHEN ABOUT TWO AND TWENTY TO CHANGE HER NAME BY THE YOUNG MAN
kayray-20070425-per04-per0095 WHO NOT LONG AFTERWARDS FOUND A MORE WILLING MIND IN HER YOUNGER SISTER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0096 AND LADY RUSSELL HAD LAMENTED HER REFUSAL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0097 FOR CHARLES MUSGROVE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A MAN WHOSE LANDED PROPERTY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0098 AND GENERAL IMPORTANCE WERE SECOND IN THAT COUNTRY ONLY TO SIR WALTER'S
kayray-20070425-per04-per0099 AND OF GOOD CHARACTER AND APPEARANCE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0100 AND HOWEVER LADY RUSSELL MIGHT HAVE ASKED YET FOR SOMETHING MORE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0101 WHILE ANNE WAS NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04-per0102 SHE WOULD HAVE REJOICED TO SEE HER AT TWENTY TWO SO RESPECTABLY REMOVED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0103 FROM THE PARTIALITIES AND INJUSTICE OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0104 AND SETTLED SO PERMANENTLY NEAR HERSELF BUT IN THIS CASE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0105 ANNE HAD LEFT NOTHING FOR ADVICE TO DO AND THOUGH LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0106 AS SATISFIED AS EVER WITH HER OWN DISCRETION
kayray-20070425-per04-per0107 NEVER WISHED THE PAST UNDONE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0108 SHE BEGAN NOW TO HAVE THE ANXIETY WHICH BORDERS ON HOPELESSNESS FOR ANNE'S BEING TEMPTED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0109 BY SOME MAN OF TALENTS AND INDEPENDENCE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0110 TO ENTER A STATE FOR WHICH SHE HELD HER TO BE PECULIARLY FITTED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0111 BY HER WARM AFFECTIONS AND DOMESTIC HABITS THEY KNEW NOT EACH OTHER'S OPINION
kayray-20070425-per04-per0112 EITHER ITS CONSTANCY OR ITS CHANGE ON THE ONE LEADING POINT OF ANNE'S CONDUCT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0113 FOR THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER ALLUDED TO BUT ANNE AT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0114 SEVEN AND TWENTY THOUGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN MADE TO THINK AT NINETEEN
kayray-20070425-per04-per0115 SHE DID NOT BLAME LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0116 SHE DID NOT BLAME HERSELF FOR HAVING BEEN GUIDED BY HER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0117 BUT SHE FELT THAT WERE ANY YOUNG PERSON IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
kayray-20070425-per04-per0118 TO APPLY TO HER FOR COUNSEL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0119 THEY WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ANY OF SUCH CERTAIN IMMEDIATE WRETCHEDNESS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0120 SUCH UNCERTAIN FUTURE GOOD SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0121 UNDER EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF DISAPPROBATION AT HOME
kayray-20070425-per04-per0122 AND EVERY ANXIETY ATTENDING HIS PROFESSION ALL THEIR PROBABLE FEARS DELAYS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0123 SHE SHOULD YET HAVE BEEN A HAPPIER WOMAN IN MAINTAINING THE ENGAGEMENT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0124 THAN SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SACRIFICE OF IT AND THIS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0125 SHE FULLY BELIEVED HAD THE USUAL SHARE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0126 HAD EVEN MORE THAN THE USUAL SHARE OF ALL SUCH SOLICITUDES AND SUSPENSE BEEN THEIRS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0127 WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THEIR CASE WHICH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0128 AS IT HAPPENED WOULD HAVE BESTOWED EARLIER PROSPERITY THAN COULD BE REASONABLY CALCULATED ON
kayray-20070425-per04-per0129 ALL HIS SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS ALL HIS CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0130 HIS GENIUS AND ARDOUR HAD SEEMED TO FORESEE AND TO COMMAND HIS PROSPEROUS PATH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0131 HE HAD VERY SOON AFTER THEIR ENGAGEMENT CEASED GOT EMPLOY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0132 AND ALL THAT HE HAD TOLD HER WOULD FOLLOW HAD TAKEN PLACE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0133 HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AND EARLY GAINED THE OTHER STEP IN RANK
kayray-20070425-per04-per0134 AND MUST NOW BY SUCCESSIVE CAPTURES HAVE MADE A HANDSOME FORTUNE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0135 SHE HAD ONLY NAVY LISTS AND NEWSPAPERS FOR HER AUTHORITY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0136 BUT SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS BEING RICH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0137 AND IN FAVOUR OF HIS CONSTANCY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0138 SHE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM MARRIED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0139 HOW ELOQUENT COULD ANNE ELLIOT HAVE BEEN HOW ELOQUENT AT LEAST
kayray-20070425-per04-per0140 WERE HER WISHES ON THE SIDE OF EARLY WARM ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0141 AND A CHEERFUL CONFIDENCE IN FUTURITY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0142 AGAINST THAT OVER ANXIOUS CAUTION WHICH SEEMS TO INSULT EXERTION AND DISTRUST PROVIDENCE
kayray-20070425-per04-per0143 SHE HAD BEEN FORCED INTO PRUDENCE IN HER YOUTH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0144 SHE LEARNED ROMANCE AS SHE GREW OLDER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0145 THE NATURAL SEQUEL OF AN UNNATURAL BEGINNING
kayray-20070425-per04-per0146 WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RECOLLECTIONS AND FEELINGS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0147 SHE COULD NOT HEAR THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S SISTER WAS LIKELY TO LIVE AT KELLYNCH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0148 WITHOUT A REVIVAL OF FORMER PAIN
kayray-20070425-per04-per0149 AND MANY A STROLL AND MANY A SIGH WERE NECESSARY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0150 TO DISPEL THE AGITATION OF THE IDEA
kayray-20070425-per04-per0151 SHE OFTEN TOLD HERSELF IT WAS FOLLY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0152 BEFORE SHE COULD HARDEN HER NERVES SUFFICIENTLY TO FEEL THE CONTINUAL DISCUSSION OF THE CROFTS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0153 AND THEIR BUSINESS NO EVIL SHE WAS ASSISTED HOWEVER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0154 BY THAT PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AND APPARENT UNCONSCIOUSNESS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0155 AMONG THE ONLY THREE OF HER OWN FRIENDS IN THE SECRET OF THE PAST
kayray-20070425-per04-per0156 WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO DENY ANY RECOLLECTION OF IT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0157 SHE COULD DO JUSTICE TO THE SUPERIORITY OF LADY RUSSELL'S MOTIVES IN THIS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0158 OVER THOSE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH
kayray-20070425-per04-per0159 SHE COULD HONOUR ALL THE BETTER FEELINGS OF HER CALMNESS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0160 BUT THE GENERAL AIR OF OBLIVION AMONG THEM WAS HIGHLY IMPORTANT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0161 FROM WHATEVER IT SPRUNG AND IN THE EVENT OF ADMIRAL CROFT'S REALLY TAKING KELLYNCH HALL
kayray-20070425-per04-per0162 SHE REJOICED ANEW OVER THE CONVICTION WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN MOST GRATEFUL TO HER
kayray-20070425-per04-per0163 OF THE PAST BEING KNOWN TO THOSE THREE ONLY AMONG HER CONNEXIONS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0164 BY WHOM NO SYLLABLE SHE BELIEVED WOULD EVER BE WHISPERED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0165 AND IN THE TRUST THAT AMONG HIS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0166 THE BROTHER ONLY WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN RESIDING HAD RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION OF THEIR SHORT LIVED ENGAGEMENT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0167 THAT BROTHER HAD BEEN LONG REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY
kayray-20070425-per04-per0168 AND BEING A SENSIBLE MAN AND MOREOVER A SINGLE MAN AT THE TIME
kayray-20070425-per04-per0169 SHE HAD A FOND DEPENDENCE ON NO HUMAN CREATURE'S HAVING HEARD OF IT FROM HIM
kayray-20070425-per04-per0170 THE SISTER MRS CROFT
kayray-20070425-per04-per0171 HAD THEN BEEN OUT OF ENGLAND ACCOMPANYING HER HUSBAND ON A FOREIGN STATION
kayray-20070425-per04-per0172 AND HER OWN SISTER MARY HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WHILE IT ALL OCCURRED
kayray-20070425-per04-per0173 AND NEVER ADMITTED BY THE PRIDE OF SOME
kayray-20070425-per04-per0174 AND THE DELICACY OF OTHERS TO THE SMALLEST KNOWLEDGE OF IT AFTERWARDS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0175 WITH THESE SUPPORTS SHE HOPED THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND THE CROFTS
kayray-20070425-per04-per0176 WHICH WITH LADY RUSSELL STILL RESIDENT IN KELLYNCH AND MARY FIXED ONLY THREE MILES OFF
kayray-20070425-per04-per0177 MUST BE ANTICIPATED NEED NOT INVOLVE ANY PARTICULAR AWKWARDNESS

kayray-20070527-per07-per0005 A VERY FEW DAYS MORE AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS KNOWN TO BE AT KELLYNCH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0006 AND MR MUSGROVE HAD CALLED ON HIM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0007 AND COME BACK WARM IN HIS PRAISE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0008 AND HE WAS ENGAGED WITH THE CROFTS TO DINE AT UPPERCROSS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK
kayray-20070527-per07-per0009 IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MR MUSGROVE TO FIND THAT NO EARLIER DAY COULD BE FIXED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0010 SO IMPATIENT WAS HE TO SHEW HIS GRATITUDE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0011 BY SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH UNDER HIS OWN ROOF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0012 AND WELCOMING HIM TO ALL THAT WAS STRONGEST AND BEST IN HIS CELLARS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0013 BUT A WEEK MUST PASS ONLY A WEEK IN ANNE'S RECKONING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0014 AND THEN SHE SUPPOSED THEY MUST MEET
kayray-20070527-per07-per0015 AND SOON SHE BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE COULD FEEL SECURE EVEN FOR A WEEK
kayray-20070527-per07-per0016 CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MADE A VERY EARLY RETURN TO MR MUSGROVE'S CIVILITY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0017 AND SHE WAS ALL BUT CALLING THERE IN THE SAME HALF HOUR
kayray-20070527-per07-per0018 SHE AND MARY WERE ACTUALLY SETTING FORWARD FOR THE GREAT HOUSE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0019 WHERE AS SHE AFTERWARDS LEARNT THEY MUST INEVITABLY HAVE FOUND HIM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0020 WHEN THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE ELDEST BOY'S BEING AT THAT MOMENT BROUGHT HOME IN CONSEQUENCE OF A BAD FALL
kayray-20070527-per07-per0021 THE CHILD'S SITUATION PUT THE VISIT ENTIRELY ASIDE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0022 BUT SHE COULD NOT HEAR OF HER ESCAPE WITH INDIFFERENCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0023 EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE SERIOUS ANXIETY WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS FELT ON HIS ACCOUNT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0024 HIS COLLAR BONE WAS FOUND TO BE DISLOCATED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0025 AND SUCH INJURY RECEIVED IN THE BACK AS ROUSED THE MOST ALARMING IDEAS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0026 IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF DISTRESS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0027 AND ANNE HAD EVERY THING TO DO AT ONCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0028 THE APOTHECARY TO SEND FOR THE FATHER TO HAVE PURSUED AND INFORMED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0029 THE MOTHER TO SUPPORT AND KEEP FROM HYSTERICS THE SERVANTS TO CONTROL
kayray-20070527-per07-per0030 THE YOUNGEST CHILD TO BANISH AND THE POOR SUFFERING ONE TO ATTEND AND SOOTHE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0031 BESIDES SENDING AS SOON AS SHE RECOLLECTED IT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0032 PROPER NOTICE TO THE OTHER HOUSE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0033 WHICH BROUGHT HER AN ACCESSION RATHER OF FRIGHTENED ENQUIRING COMPANIONS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0034 THAN OF VERY USEFUL ASSISTANTS HER BROTHER'S RETURN WAS THE FIRST COMFORT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0035 HE COULD TAKE BEST CARE OF HIS WIFE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0036 AND THE SECOND BLESSING WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THE APOTHECARY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0037 TILL HE CAME AND HAD EXAMINED THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0038 THEIR APPREHENSIONS WERE THE WORSE FOR BEING VAGUE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0039 THEY SUSPECTED GREAT INJURY BUT KNEW NOT WHERE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0040 BUT NOW THE COLLAR BONE WAS SOON REPLACED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0041 AND THOUGH MR ROBINSON FELT AND FELT AND RUBBED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0042 AND LOOKED GRAVE AND SPOKE LOW WORDS BOTH TO THE FATHER AND THE AUNT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0043 STILL THEY WERE ALL TO HOPE THE BEST
kayray-20070527-per07-per0044 AND TO BE ABLE TO PART AND EAT THEIR DINNER IN TOLERABLE EASE OF MIND
kayray-20070527-per07-per0045 AND THEN IT WAS JUST BEFORE THEY PARTED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0046 THAT THE TWO YOUNG AUNTS WERE ABLE SO FAR TO DIGRESS FROM THEIR NEPHEW'S STATE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0047 AS TO GIVE THE INFORMATION OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S VISIT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0048 STAYING FIVE MINUTES BEHIND THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0049 TO ENDEAVOUR TO EXPRESS HOW PERFECTLY DELIGHTED THEY WERE WITH HIM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0050 HOW MUCH HANDSOMER HOW INFINITELY MORE AGREEABLE THEY THOUGHT HIM THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL AMONG THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0051 WHO HAD BEEN AT ALL A FAVOURITE BEFORE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0052 HOW GLAD THEY HAD BEEN TO HEAR PAPA INVITE HIM TO STAY DINNER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0053 HOW SORRY WHEN HE SAID IT WAS QUITE OUT OF HIS POWER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0054 AND HOW GLAD AGAIN WHEN HE HAD PROMISED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0055 IN REPLY TO PAPA AND MAMMA'S FARTHER PRESSING INVITATIONS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0056 TO COME AND DINE WITH THEM ON THE MORROW
kayray-20070527-per07-per0057 ACTUALLY ON THE MORROW AND HE HAD PROMISED IT IN SO PLEASANT A MANNER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0058 AS IF HE FELT ALL THE MOTIVE OF THEIR ATTENTION JUST AS HE OUGHT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0059 AND IN SHORT HE HAD LOOKED AND SAID EVERYTHING WITH SUCH EXQUISITE GRACE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0060 THAT THEY COULD ASSURE THEM ALL THEIR HEADS WERE BOTH TURNED BY HIM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0061 AND OFF THEY RAN QUITE AS FULL OF GLEE AS OF LOVE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0062 AND APPARENTLY MORE FULL OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAN OF LITTLE CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0063 THE SAME STORY AND THE SAME RAPTURES WERE REPEATED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0064 WHEN THE TWO GIRLS CAME WITH THEIR FATHER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0065 THROUGH THE GLOOM OF THE EVENING TO MAKE ENQUIRIES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0066 AND MR MUSGROVE NO LONGER UNDER THE FIRST UNEASINESS ABOUT HIS HEIR
kayray-20070527-per07-per0067 COULD ADD HIS CONFIRMATION AND PRAISE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0068 AND HOPE THERE WOULD BE NOW NO OCCASION FOR PUTTING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OFF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0069 AND ONLY BE SORRY TO THINK THAT THE COTTAGE PARTY PROBABLY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0070 WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE THE LITTLE BOY TO GIVE HIM THE MEETING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0071 OH NO AS TO LEAVING THE LITTLE BOY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0072 BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER WERE IN MUCH TOO STRONG AND RECENT ALARM TO BEAR THE THOUGHT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0073 AND ANNE IN THE JOY OF THE ESCAPE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0074 COULD NOT HELP ADDING HER WARM PROTESTATIONS TO THEIRS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0075 CHARLES MUSGROVE INDEED AFTERWARDS SHEWED MORE OF INCLINATION
kayray-20070527-per07-per0076 THE CHILD WAS GOING ON SO WELL AND
kayray-20070527-per07-per0077 HE WISHED SO MUCH TO BE INTRODUCED TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0078 PERHAPS HE MIGHT JOIN THEM IN THE EVENING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0079 HE WOULD NOT DINE FROM HOME BUT HE MIGHT WALK IN FOR HALF AN HOUR
kayray-20070527-per07-per0080 BUT IN THIS HE WAS EAGERLY OPPOSED BY HIS WIFE WITH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0081 OH NO INDEED CHARLES I CANNOT BEAR TO HAVE YOU GO AWAY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0082 ONLY THINK IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN THE CHILD HAD A GOOD NIGHT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0083 AND WAS GOING ON WELL THE NEXT DAY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0084 IT MUST BE A WORK OF TIME TO ASCERTAIN THAT NO INJURY HAD BEEN DONE TO THE SPINE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0085 BUT MR ROBINSON FOUND NOTHING TO INCREASE ALARM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0086 AND CHARLES MUSGROVE BEGAN CONSEQUENTLY TO FEEL NO NECESSITY FOR LONGER CONFINEMENT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0087 THE CHILD WAS TO BE KEPT IN BED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0088 AND AMUSED AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0089 BUT WHAT WAS THERE FOR A FATHER TO DO
kayray-20070527-per07-per0090 THIS WAS QUITE A FEMALE CASE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0091 AND IT WOULD BE HIGHLY ABSURD IN HIM WHO COULD BE OF NO USE AT HOME TO SHUT HIMSELF UP
kayray-20070527-per07-per0092 HIS FATHER VERY MUCH WISHED HIM TO MEET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0093 AND THERE BEING NO SUFFICIENT REASON AGAINST IT HE OUGHT TO GO
kayray-20070527-per07-per0094 AND IT ENDED IN HIS MAKING A BOLD PUBLIC DECLARATION
kayray-20070527-per07-per0095 WHEN HE CAME IN FROM SHOOTING OF HIS MEANING TO DRESS DIRECTLY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0096 AND DINE AT THE OTHER HOUSE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0097 NOTHING CAN BE GOING ON BETTER THAN THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0098 SAID HE SO I TOLD MY FATHER JUST NOW THAT I WOULD COME
kayray-20070527-per07-per0099 AND HE THOUGHT ME QUITE RIGHT YOUR SISTER BEING WITH YOU MY LOVE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0100 I HAVE NO SCRUPLE AT ALL YOU WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE HIM YOURSELF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0101 BUT YOU SEE I CAN BE OF NO USE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0102 ANNE WILL SEND FOR ME IF ANYTHING IS THE MATTER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0103 HUSBANDS AND WIVES GENERALLY UNDERSTAND WHEN OPPOSITION WILL BE VAIN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0104 MARY KNEW FROM CHARLES'S MANNER OF SPEAKING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0105 THAT HE WAS QUITE DETERMINED ON GOING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0106 AND THAT IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO TEAZE HIM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0107 SHE SAID NOTHING THEREFORE TILL HE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0108 BUT AS SOON AS THERE WAS ONLY ANNE TO HEAR
kayray-20070527-per07-per0109 SO YOU AND I ARE TO BE LEFT TO SHIFT BY OURSELVES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0110 WITH THIS POOR SICK CHILD AND NOT A CREATURE COMING NEAR US ALL THE EVENING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0111 I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE THIS IS ALWAYS MY LUCK
kayray-20070527-per07-per0112 IF THERE IS ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE GOING ON
kayray-20070527-per07-per0113 MEN ARE ALWAYS SURE TO GET OUT OF IT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0114 AND CHARLES IS AS BAD AS ANY OF THEM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0115 VERY UNFEELING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0116 I MUST SAY IT IS VERY UNFEELING OF HIM TO BE RUNNING AWAY FROM HIS POOR LITTLE BOY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0117 TALKS OF HIS BEING GOING ON SO WELL HOW
kayray-20070527-per07-per0118 DOES HE KNOW THAT HE IS GOING ON WELL OR
kayray-20070527-per07-per0119 THAT THERE MAY NOT BE A SUDDEN CHANGE HALF AN HOUR HENCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0120 I DID NOT THINK CHARLES WOULD HAVE BEEN SO UNFEELING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0121 SO HERE HE IS TO GO AWAY AND ENJOY HIMSELF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0122 AND BECAUSE I AM THE POOR MOTHER I AM NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO STIR
kayray-20070527-per07-per0123 AND YET I AM SURE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0124 I AM MORE UNFIT THAN ANYBODY ELSE TO BE ABOUT THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0125 MY BEING THE MOTHER IS THE VERY REASON WHY MY FEELINGS SHOULD NOT BE TRIED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0126 I AM NOT AT ALL EQUAL TO IT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0127 YOU SAW HOW HYSTERICAL I WAS YESTERDAY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0128 BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE EFFECT OF THE SUDDENNESS OF YOUR ALARM OF THE SHOCK
kayray-20070527-per07-per0129 YOU WILL NOT BE HYSTERICAL AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0130 I DARE SAY WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO DISTRESS US
kayray-20070527-per07-per0131 I PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND MR ROBINSON'S DIRECTIONS AND HAVE NO FEARS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0132 AND INDEED MARY I CANNOT WONDER AT YOUR HUSBAND
kayray-20070527-per07-per0133 NURSING DOES NOT BELONG TO A MAN IT IS NOT HIS PROVINCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0134 A SICK CHILD IS ALWAYS THE MOTHER'S PROPERTY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0135 HER OWN FEELINGS GENERALLY MAKE IT SO
kayray-20070527-per07-per0136 I HOPE I AM AS FOND OF MY CHILD AS ANY MOTHER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0137 BUT I DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM OF ANY MORE USE IN THE SICK ROOM THAN CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0138 FOR I CANNOT BE ALWAYS SCOLDING AND TEAZING THE POOR CHILD WHEN IT IS ILL
kayray-20070527-per07-per0139 AND YOU SAW THIS MORNING THAT IF I TOLD HIM TO KEEP QUIET
kayray-20070527-per07-per0140 HE WAS SURE TO BEGIN KICKING ABOUT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0141 I HAVE NOT NERVES FOR THE SORT OF THING BUT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0142 COULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE YOURSELF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0143 TO BE SPENDING THE WHOLE EVENING AWAY FROM THE POOR BOY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0144 YES YOU SEE HIS PAPA CAN AND WHY SHOULD NOT I
kayray-20070527-per07-per0145 JEMIMA IS SO CAREFUL AND SHE COULD SEND US WORD EVERY HOUR HOW HE WAS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0146 I REALLY THINK CHARLES MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TOLD HIS FATHER WE WOULD ALL COME
kayray-20070527-per07-per0147 I AM NOT MORE ALARMED ABOUT LITTLE CHARLES NOW THAN HE IS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0148 I WAS DREADFULLY ALARMED YESTERDAY BUT THE CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO DAY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0149 WELL IF YOU DO NOT THINK IT TOO LATE TO GIVE NOTICE FOR YOURSELF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0150 SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO GO AS WELL AS YOUR HUSBAND
kayray-20070527-per07-per0151 LEAVE LITTLE CHARLES TO MY CARE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0152 MR AND MRS MUSGROVE CANNOT THINK IT WRONG WHILE I REMAIN WITH HIM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0153 ARE YOU SERIOUS CRIED MARY HER EYES BRIGHTENING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0154 DEAR ME THAT'S A VERY GOOD THOUGHT VERY GOOD INDEED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0155 TO BE SURE I MAY JUST AS WELL GO AS NOT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0156 FOR I AM OF NO USE AT HOME AM I
kayray-20070527-per07-per0157 AND IT ONLY HARASSES ME YOU WHO HAVE NOT A MOTHER'S FEELINGS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0158 ARE A GREAT DEAL THE PROPEREST PERSON
kayray-20070527-per07-per0159 YOU CAN MAKE LITTLE CHARLES DO ANYTHING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0160 HE ALWAYS MINDS YOU AT A WORD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0161 IT WILL BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN LEAVING HIM ONLY WITH JEMIMA
kayray-20070527-per07-per0162 OH I SHALL CERTAINLY GO I AM SURE I OUGHT IF I CAN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0163 QUITE AS MUCH AS CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0164 FOR THEY WANT ME EXCESSIVELY TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0165 AND I KNOW YOU DO NOT MIND BEING LEFT ALONE AN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0166 EXCELLENT THOUGHT OF YOURS INDEED ANNE I WILL GO AND TELL CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0167 AND GET READY DIRECTLY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0168 YOU CAN SEND FOR US YOU KNOW AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE IF ANYTHING IS THE MATTER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0169 BUT I DARE SAY THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO ALARM YOU
kayray-20070527-per07-per0170 I SHOULD NOT GO YOU MAY BE SURE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0171 IF I DID NOT FEEL QUITE AT EASE ABOUT MY DEAR CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0172 THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS TAPPING AT HER HUSBAND'S DRESSING ROOM DOOR
kayray-20070527-per07-per0173 AND AS ANNE FOLLOWED HER UP STAIRS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0174 SHE WAS IN TIME FOR THE WHOLE CONVERSATION WHICH BEGAN WITH MARY'S SAYING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0175 IN A TONE OF GREAT EXULTATION I MEAN TO GO WITH YOU CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0176 FOR I AM OF NO MORE USE AT HOME THAN YOU ARE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0177 IF I WERE TO SHUT MYSELF UP FOR EVER WITH THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0178 I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE DID NOT LIKE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0179 ANNE WILL STAY ANNE UNDERTAKES TO STAY AT HOME
kayray-20070527-per07-per0180 AND TAKE CARE OF HIM IT IS ANNE'S OWN PROPOSAL
kayray-20070527-per07-per0181 AND SO I SHALL GO WITH YOU
kayray-20070527-per07-per0182 WHICH WILL BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0183 FOR I HAVE NOT DINED AT THE OTHER HOUSE SINCE TUESDAY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0184 THIS IS VERY KIND OF ANNE WAS HER HUSBAND'S ANSWER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0185 AND I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU GO
kayray-20070527-per07-per0186 BUT IT SEEMS RATHER HARD THAT SHE SHOULD BE LEFT AT HOME BY HERSELF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0187 TO NURSE OUR SICK CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0188 ANNE WAS NOW AT HAND TO TAKE UP HER OWN CAUSE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0189 AND THE SINCERITY OF HER MANNER BEING SOON SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE HIM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0190 WHERE CONVICTION WAS AT LEAST VERY AGREEABLE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0191 HE HAD NO FARTHER SCRUPLES AS TO HER BEING LEFT TO DINE ALONE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0192 THOUGH HE STILL WANTED HER TO JOIN THEM IN THE EVENING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0193 WHEN THE CHILD MIGHT BE AT REST FOR THE NIGHT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0194 AND KINDLY URGED HER TO LET HIM COME AND FETCH HER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0195 BUT SHE WAS QUITE UNPERSUADABLE AND THIS BEING THE CASE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0196 SHE HAD ERE LONG THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM SET OFF TOGETHER IN HIGH SPIRITS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0197 THEY WERE GONE SHE HOPED TO BE HAPPY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0198 HOWEVER ODDLY CONSTRUCTED SUCH HAPPINESS MIGHT SEEM AS FOR HERSELF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0199 SHE WAS LEFT WITH AS MANY SENSATIONS OF COMFORT AS WERE PERHAPS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0200 EVER LIKELY TO BE HERS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0201 SHE KNEW HERSELF TO BE OF THE FIRST UTILITY TO THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0202 AND WHAT WAS IT TO HER IF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0203 FREDERICK WENTWORTH WERE ONLY HALF A MILE DISTANT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0204 MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO OTHERS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0205 SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW HOW HE FELT AS TO A MEETING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0206 PERHAPS INDIFFERENT IF INDIFFERENCE COULD EXIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0207 HE MUST BE EITHER INDIFFERENT OR UNWILLING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0208 HAD HE WISHED EVER TO SEE HER AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0209 HE NEED NOT HAVE WAITED TILL THIS TIME
kayray-20070527-per07-per0210 HE WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT SHE COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PLACE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0211 SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
kayray-20070527-per07-per0212 WHEN EVENTS HAD BEEN EARLY GIVING HIM THE INDEPENDENCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0213 WHICH ALONE HAD BEEN WANTING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0214 HER BROTHER AND SISTER CAME BACK DELIGHTED WITH THEIR NEW ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0215 AND THEIR VISIT IN GENERAL THERE HAD BEEN MUSIC SINGING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0216 TALKING LAUGHING ALL THAT WAS MOST AGREEABLE CHARMING MANNERS IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0217 NO SHYNESS OR RESERVE THEY SEEMED ALL TO KNOW EACH OTHER PERFECTLY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0218 AND HE WAS COMING THE VERY NEXT MORNING TO SHOOT WITH CHARLES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0219 HE WAS TO COME TO BREAKFAST BUT NOT AT THE COTTAGE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0220 THOUGH THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED AT FIRST
kayray-20070527-per07-per0221 BUT THEN HE HAD BEEN PRESSED TO COME TO THE GREAT HOUSE INSTEAD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0222 AND HE SEEMED AFRAID OF BEING IN MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE'S WAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0223 AND THEREFORE SOMEHOW THEY HARDLY KNEW HOW
kayray-20070527-per07-per0224 IT ENDED IN CHARLES'S BEING TO MEET HIM TO BREAKFAST AT HIS FATHER'S
kayray-20070527-per07-per0225 ANNE UNDERSTOOD IT HE WISHED TO AVOID SEEING HER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0226 HE HAD INQUIRED AFTER HER SHE FOUND SLIGHTLY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0227 AS MIGHT SUIT A FORMER SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0228 SEEMING TO ACKNOWLEDGE SUCH AS SHE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED ACTUATED PERHAPS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0229 BY THE SAME VIEW OF ESCAPING INTRODUCTION WHEN THEY WERE TO MEET
kayray-20070527-per07-per0230 THE MORNING HOURS OF THE COTTAGE WERE ALWAYS LATER THAN THOSE OF THE OTHER HOUSE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0231 AND ON THE MORROW THE DIFFERENCE WAS SO GREAT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0232 THAT MARY AND ANNE WERE NOT MORE THAN BEGINNING BREAKFAST
kayray-20070527-per07-per0233 WHEN CHARLES CAME IN TO SAY THAT THEY WERE JUST SETTING OFF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0234 THAT HE WAS COME FOR HIS DOGS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0235 THAT HIS SISTERS WERE FOLLOWING WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0236 HIS SISTERS MEANING TO VISIT MARY AND THE CHILD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0237 AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH PROPOSING ALSO TO WAIT ON HER FOR A FEW MINUTES IF NOT INCONVENIENT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0238 AND THOUGH CHARLES HAD ANSWERED FOR THE CHILD'S BEING IN NO SUCH STATE AS COULD MAKE IT INCONVENIENT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0239 CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT HIS RUNNING ON TO GIVE NOTICE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0240 MARY VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY THIS ATTENTION WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE HIM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0241 WHILE A THOUSAND FEELINGS RUSHED ON ANNE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0242 OF WHICH THIS WAS THE MOST CONSOLING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0243 THAT IT WOULD SOON BE OVER AND IT WAS SOON OVER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0244 IN TWO MINUTES AFTER CHARLES'S PREPARATION THE OTHERS APPEARED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0245 THEY WERE IN THE DRAWING ROOM HER EYE HALF MET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
kayray-20070527-per07-per0246 A BOW A CURTSEY PASSED SHE HEARD HIS VOICE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0247 HE TALKED TO MARY SAID ALL THAT WAS RIGHT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0248 SAID SOMETHING TO THE MISS MUSGROVES ENOUGH TO MARK AN EASY FOOTING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0249 THE ROOM SEEMED FULL FULL OF PERSONS AND VOICES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0250 BUT A FEW MINUTES ENDED IT CHARLES SHEWED HIMSELF AT THE WINDOW
kayray-20070527-per07-per0251 ALL WAS READY THEIR VISITOR HAD BOWED AND WAS GONE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0252 THE MISS MUSGROVES WERE GONE TOO
kayray-20070527-per07-per0253 SUDDENLY RESOLVING TO WALK TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE WITH THE SPORTSMEN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0254 THE ROOM WAS CLEARED AND ANNE MIGHT FINISH HER BREAKFAST AS SHE COULD IT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0255 IS OVER IT IS OVER SHE REPEATED TO HERSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN IN NERVOUS GRATITUDE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0256 THE WORST IS OVER MARY TALKED BUT SHE COULD NOT ATTEND
kayray-20070527-per07-per0257 SHE HAD SEEN HIM THEY HAD MET
kayray-20070527-per07-per0258 THEY HAD BEEN ONCE MORE IN THE SAME ROOM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0259 SOON HOWEVER SHE BEGAN TO REASON WITH HERSELF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0260 AND TRY TO BE FEELING LESS EIGHT YEARS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0261 ALMOST EIGHT YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE ALL HAD BEEN GIVEN UP
kayray-20070527-per07-per0262 HOW ABSURD TO BE RESUMING THE AGITATION WHICH SUCH AN INTERVAL HAD BANISHED INTO DISTANCE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0263 AND INDISTINCTNESS WHAT MIGHT NOT EIGHT YEARS DO EVENTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
kayray-20070527-per07-per0264 CHANGES ALIENATIONS REMOVALS ALL ALL MUST BE COMPRISED IN IT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0265 AND OBLIVION OF THE PAST HOW NATURAL HOW CERTAIN TOO
kayray-20070527-per07-per0266 IT INCLUDED NEARLY A THIRD PART OF HER OWN LIFE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0267 ALAS WITH ALL HER REASONING SHE FOUND THAT TO RETENTIVE FEELINGS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0268 EIGHT YEARS MAY BE LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0269 NOW HOW WERE HIS SENTIMENTS TO BE READ
kayray-20070527-per07-per0270 WAS THIS LIKE WISHING TO AVOID HER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0271 AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS HATING HERSELF FOR THE FOLLY WHICH ASKED THE QUESTION
kayray-20070527-per07-per0272 ON ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH PERHAPS HER UTMOST WISDOM MIGHT NOT HAVE PREVENTED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0273 SHE WAS SOON SPARED ALL SUSPENSE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0274 FOR AFTER THE MISS MUSGROVES HAD RETURNED AND FINISHED THEIR VISIT AT THE COTTAGE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0275 SHE HAD THIS SPONTANEOUS INFORMATION FROM MARY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0276 CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IS NOT VERY GALLANT BY YOU ANNE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0277 THOUGH HE WAS SO ATTENTIVE TO ME
kayray-20070527-per07-per0278 HENRIETTA ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF YOU WHEN THEY WENT AWAY AND HE SAID
kayray-20070527-per07-per0279 YOU WERE SO ALTERED HE SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN YOU AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0280 MARY HAD NO FEELINGS TO MAKE HER RESPECT HER SISTER'S IN A COMMON WAY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0281 BUT SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF BEING INFLICTING ANY PECULIAR WOUND
kayray-20070527-per07-per0282 ALTERED BEYOND HIS KNOWLEDGE ANNE FULLY SUBMITTED IN SILENT DEEP MORTIFICATION
kayray-20070527-per07-per0283 DOUBTLESS IT WAS SO AND SHE COULD TAKE NO REVENGE FOR HE WAS NOT ALTERED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0284 OR NOT FOR THE WORSE SHE HAD ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF
kayray-20070527-per07-per0285 AND SHE COULD NOT THINK DIFFERENTLY LET HIM THINK OF HER AS HE WOULD
kayray-20070527-per07-per0286 NO THE YEARS WHICH HAD DESTROYED HER YOUTH AND BLOOM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0287 HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM A MORE GLOWING MANLY OPEN LOOK
kayray-20070527-per07-per0288 IN NO RESPECT LESSENING HIS PERSONAL ADVANTAGES SHE HAD SEEN THE SAME
kayray-20070527-per07-per0289 FREDERICK WENTWORTH SO ALTERED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HER AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0290 THESE WERE WORDS WHICH COULD NOT BUT DWELL WITH HER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0291 YET SHE SOON BEGAN TO REJOICE THAT SHE HAD HEARD THEM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0292 THEY WERE OF SOBERING TENDENCY THEY ALLAYED AGITATION THEY COMPOSED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0293 AND CONSEQUENTLY MUST MAKE HER HAPPIER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0294 FREDERICK WENTWORTH HAD USED SUCH WORDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THEM
kayray-20070527-per07-per0295 BUT WITHOUT AN IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE CARRIED ROUND TO HER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0296 HE HAD THOUGHT HER WRETCHEDLY ALTERED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0297 AND IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF APPEAL HAD SPOKEN AS HE FELT
kayray-20070527-per07-per0298 HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN ANNE ELLIOT SHE HAD USED HIM ILL
kayray-20070527-per07-per0299 DESERTED AND DISAPPOINTED HIM AND WORSE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0300 SHE HAD SHEWN A FEEBLENESS OF CHARACTER IN DOING SO
kayray-20070527-per07-per0301 WHICH HIS OWN DECIDED CONFIDENT TEMPER COULD NOT ENDURE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0302 SHE HAD GIVEN HIM UP TO OBLIGE OTHERS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0303 IT HAD BEEN THE EFFECT OF OVER PERSUASION
kayray-20070527-per07-per0304 IT HAD BEEN WEAKNESS AND TIMIDITY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0305 HE HAD BEEN MOST WARMLY ATTACHED TO HER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0306 AND HAD NEVER SEEN A WOMAN SINCE WHOM HE THOUGHT HER EQUAL
kayray-20070527-per07-per0307 BUT EXCEPT FROM SOME NATURAL SENSATION OF CURIOSITY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0308 HE HAD NO DESIRE OF MEETING HER AGAIN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0309 HER POWER WITH HIM WAS GONE FOR EVER
kayray-20070527-per07-per0310 IT WAS NOW HIS OBJECT TO MARRY HE WAS RICH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0311 AND BEING TURNED ON SHORE FULLY INTENDED TO SETTLE AS SOON AS HE COULD BE PROPERLY TEMPTED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0312 ACTUALLY LOOKING ROUND
kayray-20070527-per07-per0313 READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ALL THE SPEED WHICH A CLEAR HEAD AND A QUICK TASTE COULD ALLOW
kayray-20070527-per07-per0314 HE HAD A HEART FOR EITHER OF THE MISS MUSGROVES IF THEY COULD CATCH IT A
kayray-20070527-per07-per0315 HEART IN SHORT FOR ANY PLEASING YOUNG WOMAN WHO CAME IN HIS WAY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0316 EXCEPTING ANNE ELLIOT THIS WAS HIS ONLY SECRET EXCEPTION
kayray-20070527-per07-per0317 WHEN HE SAID TO HIS SISTER IN ANSWER TO HER SUPPOSITIONS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0318 YES HERE I AM SOPHIA QUITE READY TO MAKE A FOOLISH MATCH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0319 ANYBODY BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY MAY HAVE ME FOR ASKING
kayray-20070527-per07-per0320 A LITTLE BEAUTY AND A FEW SMILES
kayray-20070527-per07-per0321 AND A FEW COMPLIMENTS TO THE NAVY
kayray-20070527-per07-per0322 AND I AM A LOST MAN
kayray-20070527-per07-per0323 SHOULD NOT THIS BE ENOUGH FOR A SAILOR WHO HAS HAD NO SOCIETY AMONG WOMEN TO MAKE HIM NICE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0324 HE SAID IT SHE KNEW TO BE CONTRADICTED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0325 HIS BRIGHT PROUD EYE SPOKE THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS NICE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0326 AND ANNE ELLIOT WAS NOT OUT OF HIS THOUGHTS
kayray-20070527-per07-per0327 WHEN HE MORE SERIOUSLY DESCRIBED THE WOMAN HE SHOULD WISH TO MEET WITH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0328 A STRONG MIND WITH SWEETNESS OF MANNER MADE THE FIRST
kayray-20070527-per07-per0329 AND THE LAST OF THE DESCRIPTION
kayray-20070527-per07-per0330 THAT IS THE WOMAN I WANT SAID HE
kayray-20070527-per07-per0331 SOMETHING A LITTLE INFERIOR I SHALL OF COURSE PUT UP WITH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0332 BUT IT MUST NOT BE MUCH
kayray-20070527-per07-per0333 IF I AM A FOOL I SHALL BE A FOOL INDEED
kayray-20070527-per07-per0334 FOR I HAVE THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT MORE THAN MOST MEN

kayray-20070529-per20-per0006 WERE THE EARLIEST OF ALL THEIR PARTY AT THE ROOMS IN THE EVENING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0007 AND AS LADY DALRYMPLE MUST BE WAITED FOR
kayray-20070529-per20-per0008 THEY TOOK THEIR STATION BY ONE OF THE FIRES IN THE OCTAGON ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0009 BUT HARDLY WERE THEY SO SETTLED WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0010 AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKED IN ALONE ANNE WAS THE NEAREST TO HIM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0011 AND MAKING YET A LITTLE ADVANCE SHE INSTANTLY SPOKE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0012 HE WAS PREPARING ONLY TO BOW AND PASS ON
kayray-20070529-per20-per0013 BUT HER GENTLE HOW DO YOU DO
kayray-20070529-per20-per0014 BROUGHT HIM OUT OF THE STRAIGHT LINE TO STAND NEAR HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0015 AND MAKE ENQUIRIES IN RETURN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0016 IN SPITE OF THE FORMIDABLE FATHER AND SISTER IN THE BACK GROUND
kayray-20070529-per20-per0017 THEIR BEING IN THE BACK GROUND WAS A SUPPORT TO ANNE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0018 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THEIR LOOKS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0019 AND FELT EQUAL TO EVERYTHING WHICH SHE BELIEVED RIGHT TO BE DONE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0020 WHILE THEY WERE SPEAKING A WHISPERING BETWEEN HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH CAUGHT HER EAR
kayray-20070529-per20-per0021 SHE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH BUT SHE MUST GUESS THE SUBJECT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0022 AND ON CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MAKING A DISTANT BOW
kayray-20070529-per20-per0023 SHE COMPREHENDED THAT HER FATHER HAD JUDGED SO WELL AS TO GIVE HIM THAT SIMPLE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0024 AND SHE WAS JUST IN TIME BY A SIDE GLANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0025 TO SEE A SLIGHT CURTSEY FROM ELIZABETH HERSELF THIS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0026 THOUGH LATE AND RELUCTANT AND UNGRACIOUS WAS YET BETTER THAN NOTHING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0027 AND HER SPIRITS IMPROVED AFTER TALKING HOWEVER OF THE WEATHER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0028 AND BATH AND THE CONCERT THEIR CONVERSATION BEGAN TO FLAG
kayray-20070529-per20-per0029 AND SO LITTLE WAS SAID AT LAST THAT SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM TO GO EVERY MOMENT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0030 BUT HE DID NOT HE SEEMED IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0031 AND PRESENTLY WITH RENEWED SPIRIT WITH A LITTLE SMILE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0032 A LITTLE GLOW HE SAID
kayray-20070529-per20-per0033 I HAVE HARDLY SEEN YOU SINCE OUR DAY AT LYME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0034 I AM AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE SHOCK
kayray-20070529-per20-per0035 AND THE MORE FROM ITS NOT OVERPOWERING YOU AT THE TIME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0036 SHE ASSURED HIM THAT SHE HAD NOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0037 IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL HOUR SAID HE A FRIGHTFUL DAY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0038 AND HE PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0039 AS IF THE REMEMBRANCE WERE STILL TOO PAINFUL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0040 BUT IN A MOMENT HALF SMILING AGAIN ADDED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0041 THE DAY HAS PRODUCED SOME EFFECTS HOWEVER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0042 HAS HAD SOME CONSEQUENCES WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0043 AS THE VERY REVERSE OF FRIGHTFUL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0044 WHEN YOU HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO SUGGEST THAT BENWICK WOULD BE THE PROPEREST PERSON TO FETCH A SURGEON
kayray-20070529-per20-per0045 YOU COULD HAVE LITTLE IDEA OF HIS BEING EVENTUALLY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0046 ONE OF THOSE MOST CONCERNED IN HER RECOVERY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0047 CERTAINLY I COULD HAVE NONE BUT IT APPEARS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0048 I SHOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE A VERY HAPPY MATCH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0049 THERE ARE ON BOTH SIDES GOOD PRINCIPLES AND GOOD TEMPER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0050 YES SAID HE LOOKING NOT EXACTLY FORWARD
kayray-20070529-per20-per0051 BUT THERE I THINK ENDS THE RESEMBLANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0052 WITH ALL MY SOUL I WISH THEM HAPPY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0053 AND REJOICE OVER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF IT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0054 THEY HAVE NO DIFFICULTIES TO CONTEND WITH AT HOME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0055 NO OPPOSITION NO CAPRICE NO DELAYS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0056 THE MUSGROVES ARE BEHAVING LIKE THEMSELVES MOST HONOURABLY AND KINDLY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0057 ONLY ANXIOUS WITH TRUE PARENTAL HEARTS TO PROMOTE THEIR DAUGHTER'S COMFORT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0058 ALL THIS IS MUCH VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF THEIR HAPPINESS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0059 MORE THAN PERHAPS HE STOPPED A SUDDEN RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO OCCUR
kayray-20070529-per20-per0060 AND TO GIVE HIM SOME TASTE OF THAT EMOTION WHICH WAS REDDENING ANNE'S CHEEKS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0061 AND FIXING HER EYES ON THE GROUND
kayray-20070529-per20-per0062 AFTER CLEARING HIS THROAT HOWEVER HE PROCEEDED THUS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0063 I CONFESS THAT I DO THINK THERE IS A DISPARITY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0064 TOO GREAT A DISPARITY AND IN A POINT NO LESS ESSENTIAL THAN MIND
kayray-20070529-per20-per0065 I REGARD LOUISA MUSGROVE AS A VERY AMIABLE SWEET TEMPERED GIRL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0066 AND NOT DEFICIENT IN UNDERSTANDING BUT BENWICK IS SOMETHING MORE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0067 HE IS A CLEVER MAN A READING MAN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0068 AND I CONFESS THAT I DO CONSIDER HIS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO HER WITH SOME SURPRISE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0069 HAD IT BEEN THE EFFECT OF GRATITUDE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0070 HAD HE LEARNT TO LOVE HER BECAUSE HE BELIEVED HER TO BE PREFERRING HIM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0071 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER THING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0072 BUT I HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE IT SO
kayray-20070529-per20-per0073 IT SEEMS ON THE CONTRARY TO
kayray-20070529-per20-per0074 HAVE BEEN A PERFECTLY SPONTANEOUS UNTAUGHT FEELING ON HIS SIDE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0075 AND THIS SURPRISES ME A MAN LIKE HIM IN HIS SITUATION
kayray-20070529-per20-per0076 WITH A HEART PIERCED WOUNDED ALMOST BROKEN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0077 FANNY HARVILLE WAS A VERY SUPERIOR CREATURE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0078 AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER WAS INDEED ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0079 A MAN DOES NOT RECOVER FROM SUCH A DEVOTION OF THE HEART TO SUCH A WOMAN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0080 HE OUGHT NOT HE DOES NOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0081 EITHER FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS HOWEVER THAT HIS FRIEND HAD RECOVERED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0082 OR FROM OTHER CONSCIOUSNESS HE WENT NO FARTHER AND ANNE WHO
kayray-20070529-per20-per0083 IN SPITE OF THE AGITATED VOICE IN WHICH THE LATTER PART HAD BEEN UTTERED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0084 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE VARIOUS NOISES OF THE ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0085 THE ALMOST CEASELESS SLAM OF THE DOOR
kayray-20070529-per20-per0086 AND CEASELESS BUZZ OF PERSONS WALKING THROUGH HAD DISTINGUISHED EVERY WORD
kayray-20070529-per20-per0087 WAS STRUCK GRATIFIED CONFUSED AND BEGINNING TO BREATHE VERY QUICK
kayray-20070529-per20-per0088 AND FEEL AN HUNDRED THINGS IN A MOMENT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0089 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO ENTER ON SUCH A SUBJECT AND YET
kayray-20070529-per20-per0090 AFTER A PAUSE FEELING THE NECESSITY OF SPEAKING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0091 AND HAVING NOT THE SMALLEST WISH FOR A TOTAL CHANGE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0092 SHE ONLY DEVIATED SO FAR AS TO SAY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0093 YOU WERE A GOOD WHILE AT LYME I THINK
kayray-20070529-per20-per0094 ABOUT A FORTNIGHT I COULD NOT LEAVE IT TILL LOUISA'S DOING WELL WAS QUITE ASCERTAINED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0095 I HAD BEEN TOO DEEPLY CONCERNED IN THE MISCHIEF TO BE SOON AT PEACE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0096 IT HAD BEEN MY DOING SOLELY MINE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OBSTINATE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0097 IF I HAD NOT BEEN WEAK THE COUNTRY ROUND LYME IS VERY FINE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0098 I WALKED AND RODE A GREAT DEAL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0099 AND THE MORE I SAW THE MORE I FOUND TO ADMIRE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0100 I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE LYME AGAIN SAID ANNE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0101 INDEED I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT YOU COULD HAVE FOUND ANYTHING IN LYME TO INSPIRE SUCH A FEELING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0102 THE HORROR AND DISTRESS YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE STRETCH OF MIND
kayray-20070529-per20-per0103 THE WEAR OF SPIRITS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0104 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOUR LAST IMPRESSIONS OF LYME MUST HAVE BEEN STRONG DISGUST
kayray-20070529-per20-per0105 THE LAST HOURS WERE CERTAINLY VERY PAINFUL REPLIED ANNE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0106 BUT WHEN PAIN IS OVER THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT OFTEN BECOMES A PLEASURE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0107 ONE DOES NOT LOVE A PLACE THE LESS FOR HAVING SUFFERED IN IT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0108 UNLESS IT HAS BEEN ALL SUFFERING NOTHING BUT SUFFERING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0109 WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS THE CASE AT LYME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0110 WE WERE ONLY IN ANXIETY AND DISTRESS DURING THE LAST TWO HOURS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0111 AND PREVIOUSLY THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF ENJOYMENT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0112 SO MUCH NOVELTY AND BEAUTY I HAVE TRAVELLED SO LITTLE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0113 THAT EVERY FRESH PLACE WOULD BE INTERESTING TO ME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0114 BUT THERE IS REAL BEAUTY AT LYME AND IN SHORT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0115 WITH A FAINT BLUSH AT SOME RECOLLECTIONS ALTOGETHER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0116 MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE PLACE ARE VERY AGREEABLE AS SHE CEASED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0117 THE ENTRANCE DOOR OPENED AGAIN AND THE VERY PARTY APPEARED FOR WHOM THEY WERE WAITING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0118 LADY DALRYMPLE LADY DALRYMPLE WAS THE REJOICING SOUND
kayray-20070529-per20-per0119 AND WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS COMPATIBLE WITH ANXIOUS ELEGANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0120 SIR WALTER AND HIS TWO LADIES STEPPED FORWARD TO MEET HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0121 LADY DALRYMPLE AND MISS CARTERET ESCORTED BY MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0122 AND COLONEL WALLIS WHO HAD HAPPENED TO ARRIVE NEARLY AT THE SAME INSTANT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0123 ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM THE OTHERS JOINED THEM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0124 AND IT WAS A GROUP IN WHICH ANNE FOUND HERSELF ALSO NECESSARILY INCLUDED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0125 SHE WAS DIVIDED FROM CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THEIR INTERESTING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0126 ALMOST TOO INTERESTING CONVERSATION MUST BE BROKEN UP FOR A TIME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0127 BUT SLIGHT WAS THE PENANCE COMPARED WITH THE HAPPINESS WHICH BROUGHT IT ON
kayray-20070529-per20-per0128 SHE HAD LEARNT IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0129 MORE OF HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS LOUISA
kayray-20070529-per20-per0130 MORE OF ALL HIS FEELINGS THAN SHE DARED TO THINK OF
kayray-20070529-per20-per0131 AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE DEMANDS OF THE PARTY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0132 TO THE NEEDFUL CIVILITIES OF THE MOMENT WITH EXQUISITE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0133 THOUGH AGITATED SENSATIONS SHE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH ALL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0134 SHE HAD RECEIVED IDEAS WHICH DISPOSED HER TO BE COURTEOUS AND KIND TO ALL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0135 AND TO PITY EVERY ONE AS BEING LESS HAPPY THAN HERSELF
kayray-20070529-per20-per0136 THE DELIGHTFUL EMOTIONS WERE A LITTLE SUBDUED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0137 WHEN ON STEPPING BACK FROM THE GROUP TO BE JOINED AGAIN BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0138 SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GONE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0139 SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE HIM TURN INTO THE CONCERT ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0140 HE WAS GONE HE HAD DISAPPEARED SHE FELT A MOMENT'S REGRET
kayray-20070529-per20-per0141 BUT THEY SHOULD MEET AGAIN HE WOULD LOOK FOR HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0142 HE WOULD FIND HER OUT BEFORE THE EVENING WERE OVER AND AT PRESENT PERHAPS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0143 IT WAS AS WELL TO BE ASUNDER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0144 SHE WAS IN NEED OF A LITTLE INTERVAL FOR RECOLLECTION
kayray-20070529-per20-per0145 UPON LADY RUSSELL'S APPEARANCE SOON AFTERWARDS THE WHOLE PARTY WAS COLLECTED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0146 AND ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO MARSHAL THEMSELVES AND PROCEED INTO THE CONCERT ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0147 AND BE OF ALL THE CONSEQUENCE IN THEIR POWER DRAW AS MANY EYES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0148 EXCITE AS MANY WHISPERS AND DISTURB AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY COULD
kayray-20070529-per20-per0149 VERY VERY HAPPY WERE BOTH ELIZABETH AND ANNE ELLIOT AS THEY WALKED IN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0150 ELIZABETH ARM IN ARM WITH MISS CARTERET
kayray-20070529-per20-per0151 AND LOOKING ON THE BROAD BACK OF THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE BEFORE HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0152 HAD NOTHING TO WISH FOR WHICH DID NOT SEEM WITHIN HER REACH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0153 AND ANNE BUT IT WOULD BE AN INSULT TO THE NATURE OF ANNE'S FELICITY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0154 TO DRAW ANY COMPARISON BETWEEN IT AND HER SISTER'S
kayray-20070529-per20-per0155 THE ORIGIN OF ONE ALL SELFISH VANITY OF THE OTHER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0156 ALL GENEROUS ATTACHMENT ANNE SAW NOTHING THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE BRILLIANCY OF THE ROOM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0157 HER HAPPINESS WAS FROM WITHIN HER EYES WERE BRIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0158 AND HER CHEEKS GLOWED BUT SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0159 SHE WAS THINKING ONLY OF THE LAST HALF HOUR
kayray-20070529-per20-per0160 AND AS THEY PASSED TO THEIR SEATS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0161 HER MIND TOOK A HASTY RANGE OVER IT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0162 HIS CHOICE OF SUBJECTS HIS EXPRESSIONS AND STILL MORE HIS MANNER AND LOOK
kayray-20070529-per20-per0163 HAD BEEN SUCH AS SHE COULD SEE IN ONLY ONE LIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0164 HIS OPINION OF LOUISA MUSGROVE'S INFERIORITY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0165 AN OPINION WHICH HE HAD SEEMED SOLICITOUS TO GIVE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0166 HIS WONDER AT CAPTAIN BENWICK HIS FEELINGS AS TO A FIRST STRONG ATTACHMENT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0167 SENTENCES BEGUN WHICH HE COULD NOT FINISH HIS HALF AVERTED EYES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0168 AND MORE THAN HALF EXPRESSIVE GLANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0169 ALL ALL DECLARED THAT HE HAD A HEART RETURNING TO HER AT LEAST
kayray-20070529-per20-per0170 THAT ANGER RESENTMENT AVOIDANCE WERE NO MORE AND THAT THEY WERE SUCCEEDED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0171 NOT MERELY BY FRIENDSHIP AND REGARD BUT BY THE TENDERNESS OF THE PAST
kayray-20070529-per20-per0172 YES SOME SHARE OF THE TENDERNESS OF THE PAST
kayray-20070529-per20-per0173 SHE COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE THE CHANGE AS IMPLYING LESS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0174 HE MUST LOVE HER THESE WERE THOUGHTS WITH THEIR ATTENDANT VISIONS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0175 WHICH OCCUPIED AND FLURRIED HER TOO MUCH TO LEAVE HER ANY POWER OF OBSERVATION
kayray-20070529-per20-per0176 AND SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROOM WITHOUT HAVING A GLIMPSE OF HIM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0177 WITHOUT EVEN TRYING TO DISCERN HIM WHEN THEIR PLACES WERE DETERMINED ON
kayray-20070529-per20-per0178 AND THEY WERE ALL PROPERLY ARRANGED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0179 SHE LOOKED ROUND TO SEE IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SAME PART OF THE ROOM BUT HE WAS NOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0180 HER EYE COULD NOT REACH HIM AND THE CONCERT BEING JUST OPENING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0181 SHE MUST CONSENT FOR A TIME TO BE HAPPY IN A HUMBLER WAY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0182 THE PARTY WAS DIVIDED AND DISPOSED OF ON TWO CONTIGUOUS BENCHES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0183 ANNE WAS AMONG THOSE ON THE FOREMOST
kayray-20070529-per20-per0184 AND MR ELLIOT HAD MANOEUVRED SO WELL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0185 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS FRIEND COLONEL WALLIS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0186 AS TO HAVE A SEAT BY HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0187 MISS ELLIOT SURROUNDED BY HER COUSINS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0188 AND THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF COLONEL WALLIS'S GALLANTRY WAS QUITE CONTENTED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0189 ANNE'S MIND WAS IN A MOST FAVOURABLE STATE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE EVENING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0190 IT WAS JUST OCCUPATION ENOUGH SHE HAD FEELINGS FOR THE TENDER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0191 SPIRITS FOR THE GAY ATTENTION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC
kayray-20070529-per20-per0192 AND PATIENCE FOR THE WEARISOME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0193 AND HAD NEVER LIKED A CONCERT BETTER AT LEAST DURING THE FIRST ACT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0194 TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF IT IN THE INTERVAL SUCCEEDING AN ITALIAN SONG
kayray-20070529-per20-per0195 SHE EXPLAINED THE WORDS OF THE SONG TO MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0196 THEY HAD A CONCERT BILL BETWEEN THEM THIS SAID SHE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0197 IS NEARLY THE SENSE OR RATHER THE MEANING OF THE WORDS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0198 FOR CERTAINLY THE SENSE OF AN ITALIAN LOVE SONG MUST NOT BE TALKED OF
kayray-20070529-per20-per0199 BUT IT IS AS NEARLY THE MEANING AS I CAN GIVE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0200 FOR I DO NOT PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0201 I AM A VERY POOR ITALIAN SCHOLAR
kayray-20070529-per20-per0202 YES YES I SEE YOU ARE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0203 I SEE YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0204 YOU HAVE ONLY KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH OF THE LANGUAGE TO TRANSLATE AT SIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0205 THESE INVERTED TRANSPOSED CURTAILED ITALIAN LINES INTO CLEAR COMPREHENSIBLE ELEGANT ENGLISH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0206 YOU NEED NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE OF YOUR IGNORANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0207 HERE IS COMPLETE PROOF I WILL NOT OPPOSE SUCH KIND POLITENESS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0208 BUT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO BE EXAMINED BY A REAL PROFICIENT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0209 I HAVE NOT HAD THE PLEASURE OF VISITING IN CAMDEN PLACE SO LONG REPLIED HE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0210 WITHOUT KNOWING SOMETHING OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0211 AND I DO REGARD HER AS ONE WHO IS TOO MODEST FOR THE WORLD IN GENERAL TO BE AWARE OF HALF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0212 AND TOO HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR MODESTY TO BE NATURAL IN ANY OTHER WOMAN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0213 FOR SHAME FOR SHAME THIS IS TOO MUCH FLATTERY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0214 I FORGET WHAT WE ARE TO HAVE NEXT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0215 TURNING TO THE BILL PERHAPS SAID MR ELLIOT SPEAKING LOW
kayray-20070529-per20-per0216 I HAVE HAD A LONGER ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR CHARACTER THAN YOU ARE AWARE OF
kayray-20070529-per20-per0217 INDEED HOW SO YOU CAN HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH IT ONLY SINCE I CAME TO BATH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0218 EXCEPTING AS YOU MIGHT HEAR ME PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN OF IN MY OWN FAMILY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0219 I KNEW YOU BY REPORT LONG BEFORE YOU CAME TO BATH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0220 I HAD HEARD YOU DESCRIBED BY THOSE WHO KNEW YOU INTIMATELY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0221 I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH YOU BY CHARACTER MANY YEARS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0222 YOUR PERSON YOUR DISPOSITION ACCOMPLISHMENTS MANNER THEY WERE ALL PRESENT TO ME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0223 MR ELLIOT WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST HE HOPED TO RAISE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0224 NO ONE CAN WITHSTAND THE CHARM OF SUCH A MYSTERY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0225 TO HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED LONG AGO TO A RECENT ACQUAINTANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0226 BY NAMELESS PEOPLE IS IRRESISTIBLE AND ANNE WAS ALL CURIOSITY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0227 SHE WONDERED AND QUESTIONED HIM EAGERLY BUT IN VAIN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0228 HE DELIGHTED IN BEING ASKED BUT HE WOULD NOT TELL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0229 NO NO SOME TIME OR OTHER PERHAPS BUT NOT NOW
kayray-20070529-per20-per0230 HE WOULD MENTION NO NAMES NOW BUT SUCH HE COULD ASSURE HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0231 HAD BEEN THE FACT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0232 HE HAD MANY YEARS AGO RECEIVED SUCH A DESCRIPTION OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0233 AS HAD INSPIRED HIM WITH THE HIGHEST IDEA OF HER MERIT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0234 AND EXCITED THE WARMEST CURIOSITY TO KNOW HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0235 ANNE COULD THINK OF NO ONE SO LIKELY TO HAVE SPOKEN WITH PARTIALITY OF HER MANY YEARS AGO
kayray-20070529-per20-per0236 AS THE MR WENTWORTH OF MONKFORD CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S BROTHER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0237 HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN MR ELLIOT'S COMPANY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0238 BUT SHE HAD NOT COURAGE TO ASK THE QUESTION
kayray-20070529-per20-per0239 THE NAME OF ANNE ELLIOT SAID HE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0240 HAS LONG HAD AN INTERESTING SOUND TO ME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0241 VERY LONG HAS IT POSSESSED A CHARM OVER MY FANCY AND
kayray-20070529-per20-per0242 IF I DARED I WOULD BREATHE MY WISHES THAT THE NAME MIGHT NEVER CHANGE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0243 SUCH SHE BELIEVED WERE HIS WORDS BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE RECEIVED THEIR SOUND
kayray-20070529-per20-per0244 THAN HER ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY OTHER SOUNDS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0245 WHICH RENDERED EVERY THING ELSE TRIVIAL HER FATHER AND LADY DALRYMPLE WERE SPEAKING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0246 A WELL LOOKING MAN SAID SIR WALTER A VERY WELL LOOKING MAN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0247 A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN INDEED SAID LADY DALRYMPLE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0248 MORE AIR THAN ONE OFTEN SEES IN BATH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0249 IRISH I DARE SAY NO I JUST KNOW HIS NAME
kayray-20070529-per20-per0250 A BOWING ACQUAINTANCE WENTWORTH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OF THE NAVY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0251 HIS SISTER MARRIED MY TENANT IN SOMERSETSHIRE THE CROFT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0252 WHO RENTS KELLYNCH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0253 BEFORE SIR WALTER HAD REACHED THIS POINT ANNE'S EYES HAD CAUGHT THE RIGHT DIRECTION
kayray-20070529-per20-per0254 AND DISTINGUISHED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH STANDING AMONG A CLUSTER OF MEN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0255 AS HER EYES FELL ON HIM HIS SEEMED TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0256 IT HAD THAT APPEARANCE IT SEEMED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ONE MOMENT TOO LATE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0257 AND AS LONG AS SHE DARED OBSERVE HE DID NOT LOOK AGAIN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0258 BUT THE PERFORMANCE WAS RECOMMENCING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0259 AND SHE WAS FORCED TO SEEM TO RESTORE HER ATTENTION TO THE ORCHESTRA
kayray-20070529-per20-per0260 AND LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD WHEN SHE COULD GIVE ANOTHER GLANCE HE HAD MOVED AWAY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0261 HE COULD NOT HAVE COME NEARER TO HER IF HE WOULD
kayray-20070529-per20-per0262 SHE WAS SO SURROUNDED AND SHUT IN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0263 BUT SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE CAUGHT HIS EYE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0264 MR ELLIOT'S SPEECH TOO DISTRESSED HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0265 SHE HAD NO LONGER ANY INCLINATION TO TALK TO HIM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0266 SHE WISHED HIM NOT SO NEAR HER THE FIRST ACT WAS OVER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0267 NOW SHE HOPED FOR SOME BENEFICIAL CHANGE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0268 AND AFTER A PERIOD OF NOTHING SAYING AMONGST THE PARTY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0269 SOME OF THEM DID DECIDE ON GOING IN QUEST OF TEA
kayray-20070529-per20-per0270 ANNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW WHO DID NOT CHOOSE TO MOVE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0271 SHE REMAINED IN HER SEAT AND SO DID LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0272 BUT SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF GETTING RID OF MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0273 AND SHE DID NOT MEAN WHATEVER SHE MIGHT FEEL ON LADY RUSSELL'S ACCOUNT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0274 TO SHRINK FROM CONVERSATION WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IF HE GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0275 SHE WAS PERSUADED BY LADY RUSSELL'S COUNTENANCE THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0276 HE DID NOT COME HOWEVER ANNE SOMETIMES FANCIED SHE DISCERNED HIM AT A DISTANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0277 BUT HE NEVER CAME THE ANXIOUS INTERVAL WORE AWAY UNPRODUCTIVELY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0278 THE OTHERS RETURNED THE ROOM FILLED AGAIN BENCHES WERE RECLAIMED AND REPOSSESSED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0279 AND ANOTHER HOUR OF PLEASURE OR OF PENANCE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0280 WAS TO BE SAT OUT ANOTHER HOUR OF MUSIC WAS TO GIVE DELIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0281 OR THE GAPES AS REAL OR AFFECTED TASTE FOR IT PREVAILED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0282 TO ANNE IT CHIEFLY WORE THE PROSPECT OF AN HOUR OF AGITATION
kayray-20070529-per20-per0283 SHE COULD NOT QUIT THAT ROOM IN PEACE WITHOUT SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH ONCE MORE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0284 WITHOUT THE INTERCHANGE OF ONE FRIENDLY LOOK
kayray-20070529-per20-per0285 IN RE SETTLING THEMSELVES THERE WERE NOW MANY CHANGES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0286 THE RESULT OF WHICH WAS FAVOURABLE FOR HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0287 COLONEL WALLIS DECLINED SITTING DOWN AGAIN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0288 AND MR ELLIOT WAS INVITED BY ELIZABETH AND MISS CARTERET
kayray-20070529-per20-per0289 IN A MANNER NOT TO BE REFUSED TO SIT BETWEEN THEM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0290 AND BY SOME OTHER REMOVALS AND A LITTLE SCHEMING OF HER OWN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0291 ANNE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HERSELF MUCH NEARER THE END OF THE BENCH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0292 THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE MUCH MORE WITHIN REACH OF A PASSER BY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0293 SHE COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT COMPARING HERSELF WITH MISS LAROLLES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0294 THE INIMITABLE MISS LAROLLES BUT STILL SHE DID
kayray-20070529-per20-per0295 IT AND NOT WITH MUCH HAPPIER EFFECT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0296 THOUGH BY WHAT SEEMED PROSPERITY IN THE SHAPE OF AN EARLY ABDICATION IN HER NEXT NEIGHBOURS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0297 SHE FOUND HERSELF AT THE VERY END OF THE BENCH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0298 BEFORE THE CONCERT CLOSED SUCH WAS HER SITUATION
kayray-20070529-per20-per0299 WITH A VACANT SPACE AT HAND WHEN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS AGAIN IN SIGHT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0300 SHE SAW HIM NOT FAR OFF HE SAW HER TOO
kayray-20070529-per20-per0301 YET HE LOOKED GRAVE AND SEEMED IRRESOLUTE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0302 AND ONLY BY VERY SLOW DEGREES CAME AT LAST NEAR ENOUGH TO SPEAK TO HER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0303 SHE FELT THAT SOMETHING MUST BE THE MATTER THE CHANGE WAS INDUBITABLE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0304 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS PRESENT AIR AND WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THE OCTAGON ROOM WAS STRIKINGLY GREAT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0305 WHY WAS IT SHE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER OF LADY RUSSELL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0306 COULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANY UNPLEASANT GLANCES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0307 HE BEGAN BY SPEAKING OF THE CONCERT GRAVELY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0308 MORE LIKE THE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OF UPPERCROSS OWNED HIMSELF DISAPPOINTED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0309 HAD EXPECTED SINGING AND IN SHORT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0310 MUST CONFESS THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE SORRY WHEN IT WAS OVER
kayray-20070529-per20-per0311 ANNE REPLIED AND SPOKE IN DEFENCE OF THE PERFORMANCE SO WELL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0312 AND YET IN ALLOWANCE FOR HIS FEELINGS SO PLEASANTLY
kayray-20070529-per20-per0313 THAT HIS COUNTENANCE IMPROVED AND HE REPLIED AGAIN WITH ALMOST A SMILE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0314 THEY TALKED FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE THE IMPROVEMENT HELD
kayray-20070529-per20-per0315 HE EVEN LOOKED DOWN TOWARDS THE BENCH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0316 AS IF HE SAW A PLACE ON IT WELL WORTH OCCUPYING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0317 WHEN AT THAT MOMENT A TOUCH ON HER SHOULDER OBLIGED ANNE TO TURN ROUND
kayray-20070529-per20-per0318 IT CAME FROM MR ELLIOT HE BEGGED HER PARDON
kayray-20070529-per20-per0319 BUT SHE MUST BE APPLIED TO TO EXPLAIN ITALIAN AGAIN
kayray-20070529-per20-per0320 MISS CARTERET WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT WAS NEXT TO BE SUNG
kayray-20070529-per20-per0321 ANNE COULD NOT REFUSE BUT NEVER HAD SHE SACRIFICED TO POLITENESS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0322 WITH A MORE SUFFERING SPIRIT A FEW MINUTES
kayray-20070529-per20-per0323 THOUGH AS FEW AS POSSIBLE WERE INEVITABLY CONSUMED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0324 AND WHEN HER OWN MISTRESS AGAIN WHEN ABLE TO TURN AND LOOK AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0325 SHE FOUND HERSELF ACCOSTED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529-per20-per0326 IN A RESERVED YET HURRIED SORT OF FAREWELL
kayray-20070529-per20-per0327 HE MUST WISH HER GOOD NIGHT HE WAS GOING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0328 HE SHOULD GET HOME AS FAST AS HE COULD
kayray-20070529-per20-per0329 IS NOT THIS SONG WORTH STAYING FOR SAID ANNE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0330 SUDDENLY STRUCK BY AN IDEA WHICH MADE HER YET MORE ANXIOUS TO BE ENCOURAGING
kayray-20070529-per20-per0331 NO HE REPLIED IMPRESSIVELY THERE IS NOTHING WORTH MY STAYING FOR
kayray-20070529-per20-per0332 AND HE WAS GONE DIRECTLY JEALOUSY OF MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529-per20-per0333 IT WAS THE ONLY INTELLIGIBLE MOTIVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH JEALOUS OF HER AFFECTION
kayray-20070529-per20-per0334 COULD SHE HAVE BELIEVED IT A WEEK AGO THREE HOURS AGO
kayray-20070529-per20-per0335 FOR A MOMENT THE GRATIFICATION WAS EXQUISITE
kayray-20070529-per20-per0336 BUT ALAS THERE WERE VERY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS TO SUCCEED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0337 HOW WAS SUCH JEALOUSY TO BE QUIETED
kayray-20070529-per20-per0338 HOW WAS THE TRUTH TO REACH HIM
kayray-20070529-per20-per0339 HOW IN ALL THE PECULIAR DISADVANTAGES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SITUATIONS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0340 WOULD HE EVER LEARN OF HER REAL SENTIMENTS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0341 IT WAS MISERY TO THINK OF MR ELLIOT'S ATTENTIONS
kayray-20070529-per20-per0342 THEIR EVIL WAS INCALCULABLE END OF CHAPTER TWENTY

kayray-20070529b-per24-per0005 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR WHO CAN BE IN DOUBT OF WHAT FOLLOWED
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0006 WHEN ANY TWO YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO MARRY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0007 THEY ARE PRETTY SURE BY PERSEVERANCE TO CARRY THEIR POINT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0008 BE THEY EVER SO POOR OR EVER SO IMPRUDENT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0009 OR EVER SO LITTLE LIKELY TO BE NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER'S ULTIMATE COMFORT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0010 THIS MAY BE BAD MORALITY TO CONCLUDE WITH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0011 BUT I BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUTH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0012 AND IF SUCH PARTIES SUCCEED HOW SHOULD A CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0013 AND AN ANNE ELLIOT WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF MATURITY OF MIND
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0014 CONSCIOUSNESS OF RIGHT AND ONE INDEPENDENT FORTUNE BETWEEN THEM
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0015 FAIL OF BEARING DOWN EVERY OPPOSITION
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0016 THEY MIGHT IN FACT HAVE BORNE DOWN A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THEY MET WITH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0017 FOR THERE WAS LITTLE TO DISTRESS THEM BEYOND THE WANT OF GRACIOUSNESS AND WARMTH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0018 SIR WALTER MADE NO OBJECTION AND ELIZABETH DID NOTHING WORSE THAN LOOK COLD
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0019 AND UNCONCERNED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WITH FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0020 AND AS HIGH IN HIS PROFESSION AS MERIT AND ACTIVITY COULD PLACE HIM
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0021 WAS NO LONGER NOBODY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0022 HE WAS NOW ESTEEMED QUITE WORTHY TO ADDRESS THE DAUGHTER OF A FOOLISH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0023 SPENDTHRIFT BARONET WHO HAD NOT HAD PRINCIPLE OR SENSE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0024 IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD PLACED HIM
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0025 AND WHO COULD GIVE HIS DAUGHTER AT PRESENT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0026 BUT A SMALL PART OF THE SHARE OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0027 WHICH MUST BE HERS HEREAFTER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0028 SIR WALTER INDEED THOUGH HE HAD NO AFFECTION FOR ANNE AND NO VANITY FLATTERED
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0029 TO MAKE HIM REALLY HAPPY ON THE OCCASION
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0030 WAS VERY FAR FROM THINKING IT A BAD MATCH FOR HER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0031 ON THE CONTRARY WHEN HE SAW MORE OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0032 SAW HIM REPEATEDLY BY DAYLIGHT AND EYED HIM WELL
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0033 HE WAS VERY MUCH STRUCK BY HIS PERSONAL CLAIMS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0034 AND FELT THAT HIS SUPERIORITY OF APPEARANCE MIGHT BE NOT UNFAIRLY BALANCED AGAINST HER SUPERIORITY OF RANK
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0035 AND ALL THIS ASSISTED BY HIS WELL SOUNDING NAME
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0036 ENABLED SIR WALTER AT LAST TO PREPARE HIS PEN
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0037 WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE FOR THE INSERTION OF THE MARRIAGE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0038 IN THE VOLUME OF HONOUR
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0039 THE ONLY ONE AMONG THEM WHOSE OPPOSITION OF FEELING COULD EXCITE ANY SERIOUS ANXIETY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0040 WAS LADY RUSSELL ANNE KNEW THAT LADY RUSSELL MUST BE SUFFERING SOME PAIN
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0041 IN UNDERSTANDING AND RELINQUISHING MR ELLIOT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0042 AND BE MAKING SOME STRUGGLES TO BECOME TRULY ACQUAINTED WITH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0043 AND DO JUSTICE TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0044 THIS HOWEVER WAS WHAT LADY RUSSELL HAD NOW TO DO
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0045 SHE MUST LEARN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN WITH REGARD TO BOTH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0046 THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNFAIRLY INFLUENCED BY APPEARANCES IN EACH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0047 THAT BECAUSE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MANNERS HAD NOT SUITED HER OWN IDEAS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0048 SHE HAD BEEN TOO QUICK IN SUSPECTING THEM TO INDICATE A CHARACTER OF DANGEROUS IMPETUOSITY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0049 AND THAT BECAUSE MR ELLIOT'S MANNERS HAD PRECISELY PLEASED HER IN THEIR PROPRIETY AND CORRECTNESS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0050 THEIR GENERAL POLITENESS AND SUAVITY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0051 SHE HAD BEEN TOO QUICK IN RECEIVING THEM AS THE CERTAIN RESULT OF THE MOST CORRECT OPINIONS AND WELL REGULATED MIND
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0052 THERE WAS NOTHING LESS FOR LADY RUSSELL TO DO
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0053 THAN TO ADMIT THAT SHE HAD BEEN PRETTY COMPLETELY WRONG
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0054 AND TO TAKE UP A NEW SET OF OPINIONS AND OF HOPES
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0055 THERE IS A QUICKNESS OF PERCEPTION IN SOME
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0056 A NICETY IN THE DISCERNMENT OF CHARACTER A NATURAL PENETRATION IN SHORT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0057 WHICH NO EXPERIENCE IN OTHERS CAN EQUAL
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0058 AND LADY RUSSELL HAD BEEN LESS GIFTED IN THIS PART OF UNDERSTANDING THAN HER YOUNG FRIEND
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0059 BUT SHE WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0060 AND IF HER SECOND OBJECT WAS TO BE SENSIBLE AND WELL JUDGING
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0061 HER FIRST WAS TO SEE ANNE HAPPY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0062 SHE LOVED ANNE BETTER THAN SHE LOVED HER OWN ABILITIES
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0063 AND WHEN THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE BEGINNING WAS OVER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0064 FOUND LITTLE HARDSHIP IN ATTACHING HERSELF AS A MOTHER TO THE MAN WHO WAS SECURING THE HAPPINESS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0065 OF HER OTHER CHILD
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0066 OF ALL THE FAMILY MARY WAS PROBABLY THE ONE MOST IMMEDIATELY GRATIFIED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0067 IT WAS CREDITABLE TO HAVE A SISTER MARRIED
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0068 AND SHE MIGHT FLATTER HERSELF WITH HAVING BEEN GREATLY INSTRUMENTAL TO THE CONNEXION
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0069 BY KEEPING ANNE WITH HER IN THE AUTUMN
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0070 AND AS HER OWN SISTER MUST BE BETTER THAN HER HUSBAND'S SISTERS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0071 IT WAS VERY AGREEABLE THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHOULD BE A RICHER MAN THAN EITHER CAPTAIN BENWICK OR CHARLES HAYTER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0072 SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SUFFER PERHAPS WHEN THEY CAME INTO CONTACT AGAIN
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0073 IN SEEING ANNE RESTORED TO THE RIGHTS OF SENIORITY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0074 AND THE MISTRESS OF A VERY PRETTY LANDAULETTE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0075 BUT SHE HAD A FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO OF POWERFUL CONSOLATION
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0076 ANNE HAD NO UPPERCROSS HALL BEFORE HER NO LANDED ESTATE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0077 NO HEADSHIP OF A FAMILY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0078 AND IF THEY COULD BUT KEEP CAPTAIN WENTWORTH FROM BEING MADE A BARONET
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0079 SHE WOULD NOT CHANGE SITUATIONS WITH ANNE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0080 IT WOULD BE WELL FOR THE ELDEST SISTER IF SHE WERE EQUALLY SATISFIED WITH HER SITUATION
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0081 FOR A CHANGE IS NOT VERY PROBABLE THERE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0082 SHE HAD SOON THE MORTIFICATION OF SEEING MR ELLIOT WITHDRAW
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0083 AND NO ONE OF PROPER CONDITION HAS SINCE PRESENTED HIMSELF
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0084 TO RAISE EVEN THE UNFOUNDED HOPES WHICH SUNK WITH HIM
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0085 THE NEWS OF HIS COUSINS ANNE'S ENGAGEMENT BURST ON MR ELLIOT MOST UNEXPECTEDLY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0086 IT DERANGED HIS BEST PLAN OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0087 HIS BEST HOPE OF KEEPING SIR WALTER SINGLE BY THE WATCHFULNESS WHICH A SON IN LAW'S RIGHTS WOULD HAVE GIVEN
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0088 BUT THOUGH DISCOMFITED AND DISAPPOINTED
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0089 HE COULD STILL DO SOMETHING FOR HIS OWN INTEREST AND HIS OWN ENJOYMENT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0090 HE SOON QUITTED BATH AND ON MRS CLAY'S QUITTING IT SOON AFTERWARDS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0091 AND BEING NEXT HEARD OF AS ESTABLISHED UNDER HIS PROTECTION IN LONDON
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0092 IT WAS EVIDENT HOW DOUBLE A GAME HE HAD BEEN PLAYING
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0093 AND HOW DETERMINED HE WAS TO SAVE HIMSELF
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0094 FROM BEING CUT OUT BY ONE ARTFUL WOMAN AT LEAST
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0095 MRS CLAY'S AFFECTIONS HAD OVERPOWERED HER INTEREST
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0096 AND SHE HAD SACRIFICED FOR THE YOUNG MAN'S SAKE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0097 THE POSSIBILITY OF SCHEMING LONGER FOR SIR WALTER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0098 SHE HAS ABILITIES HOWEVER AS WELL AS AFFECTIONS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0099 AND IT IS NOW A DOUBTFUL POINT WHETHER HIS CUNNING OR HERS MAY FINALLY CARRY THE DAY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0100 WHETHER AFTER PREVENTING HER FROM BEING THE WIFE OF SIR WALTER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0101 HE MAY NOT BE WHEEDLED AND CARESSED AT LAST
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0102 INTO MAKING HER THE WIFE OF SIR WILLIAM
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0103 IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0104 WERE SHOCKED AND MORTIFIED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR COMPANION
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0105 AND THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR DECEPTION IN HER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0106 THEY HAD THEIR GREAT COUSINS TO BE SURE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0107 TO RESORT TO FOR COMFORT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0108 BUT THEY MUST LONG FEEL THAT TO FLATTER AND FOLLOW OTHERS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0109 WITHOUT BEING FLATTERED AND FOLLOWED IN TURN
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0110 IS BUT A STATE OF HALF ENJOYMENT ANNE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0111 SATISFIED AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD OF LADY RUSSELL'S MEANING TO LOVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AS SHE OUGHT
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0112 HAD NO OTHER ALLOY TO THE HAPPINESS OF HER PROSPECTS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0113 THAN WHAT AROSE FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING NO RELATIONS TO BESTOW ON HIM
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0114 WHICH A MAN OF SENSE COULD VALUE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0115 THERE SHE FELT HER OWN INFERIORITY VERY KEENLY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0116 THE DISPROPORTION IN THEIR FORTUNE WAS NOTHING
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0117 IT DID NOT GIVE HER A MOMENT'S REGRET
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0118 BUT TO HAVE NO FAMILY TO RECEIVE AND ESTIMATE HIM PROPERLY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0119 NOTHING OF RESPECTABILITY OF HARMONY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0120 OF GOOD WILL TO OFFER IN RETURN FOR ALL THE WORTH AND ALL THE PROMPT WELCOME
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0121 WHICH MET HER IN HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0122 WAS A SOURCE OF AS LIVELY PAIN AS HER MIND COULD WELL BE SENSIBLE OF
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0123 UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF OTHERWISE STRONG FELICITY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0124 SHE HAD BUT TWO FRIENDS IN THE WORLD TO ADD TO HIS LIST
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0125 LADY RUSSELL AND MRS SMITH TO THOSE HOWEVER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0126 HE WAS VERY WELL DISPOSED TO ATTACH HIMSELF
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0127 LADY RUSSELL IN SPITE OF ALL HER FORMER TRANSGRESSIONS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0128 HE COULD NOW VALUE FROM HIS HEART
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0129 WHILE HE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO SAY THAT HE BELIEVED HER TO HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN ORIGINALLY DIVIDING THEM
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0130 HE WAS READY TO SAY ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE IN HER FAVOUR
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0131 AND AS FOR MRS SMITH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0132 SHE HAD CLAIMS OF VARIOUS KINDS TO RECOMMEND HER QUICKLY AND PERMANENTLY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0133 HER RECENT GOOD OFFICES BY ANNE HAD BEEN ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0134 AND THEIR MARRIAGE INSTEAD OF DEPRIVING HER OF ONE FRIEND
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0135 SECURED HER TWO SHE WAS THEIR EARLIEST VISITOR IN THEIR SETTLED LIFE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0136 AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0137 BY PUTTING HER IN THE WAY OF RECOVERING HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY IN THE WEST INDIES
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0138 BY WRITING FOR HER ACTING FOR HER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0139 AND SEEING HER THROUGH ALL THE PETTY DIFFICULTIES OF THE CASE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0140 WITH THE ACTIVITY AND EXERTION OF A FEARLESS MAN
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0141 AND A DETERMINED FRIEND FULLY REQUITED THE SERVICES WHICH SHE HAD RENDERED
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0142 OR EVER MEANT TO RENDER TO HIS WIFE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0143 MRS SMITH'S ENJOYMENTS WERE NOT SPOILED BY THIS IMPROVEMENT OF INCOME
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0144 WITH SOME IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH AND THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH FRIENDS TO BE OFTEN WITH
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0145 FOR HER CHEERFULNESS AND MENTAL ALACRITY DID NOT FAIL HER
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0146 AND WHILE THESE PRIME SUPPLIES OF GOOD REMAINED
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0147 SHE MIGHT HAVE BID DEFIANCE EVEN TO GREATER ACCESSIONS OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0148 SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY RICH AND PERFECTLY HEALTHY
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0149 AND YET BE HAPPY HER SPRING OF FELICITY WAS IN THE GLOW OF HER SPIRITS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0150 AS HER FRIEND ANNE'S WAS IN THE WARMTH OF HER HEART
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0151 ANNE WAS TENDERNESS ITSELF AND SHE HAD THE FULL WORTH OF IT IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S AFFECTION
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0152 HIS PROFESSION WAS ALL THAT COULD EVER MAKE HER FRIENDS WISH THAT TENDERNESS LESS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0153 THE DREAD OF A FUTURE WAR ALL THAT COULD DIM HER SUNSHINE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0154 SHE GLORIED IN BEING A SAILOR'S WIFE
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0155 BUT SHE MUST PAY THE TAX OF QUICK ALARM FOR BELONGING TO THAT PROFESSION WHICH IS
kayray-20070529b-per24-per0156 IF POSSIBLE MORE DISTINGUISHED IN ITS DOMESTIC VIRTUES THAN IN ITS NATIONAL

kayray-20070604-wha-wha0077 BUT WHILE THE WHALE HAD BEEN SWIMMING
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0078 THE MARINER WHO WAS INDEED A PERSON OF INFINITE RESOURCE AND SAGACITY
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0079 HAD TAKEN HIS JACK KNIFE
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0080 AND CUT UP THE RAFT INTO A LITTLE SQUARE GRATING ALL RUNNING CRISS CROSS
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0081 AND HE HAD TIED IT FIRM WITH HIS SUSPENDERS

kayray-20070604-wha-wha0092 WHICH HE COULD NEITHER COUGH UP NOR SWALLOW DOWN
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0093 PREVENTED HIM EATING ANYTHING EXCEPT VERY VERY SMALL FISH
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0094 AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY WHALES NOWADAYS NEVER EAT MEN
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0095 OR BOYS OR LITTLE GIRLS
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0096 THE SMALL STUTE FISH WENT AND HID HIMSELF IN THE MUD UNDER THE DOOR SILLS OF THE EQUATOR

kayray-20070604-wha-wha0100 THE SUSPENDERS WERE LEFT BEHIND YOU SEE TO TIE THE GRATING WITH
kayray-20070604-wha-wha0101 AND THAT IS THE END OF THAT TALE

kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0006 ONCE UPON A TIME ON AN UNINHABITED ISLAND ON THE SHORES OF THE RED SEA
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0007 THERE LIVED A PARSEE FROM WHOSE HAT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0008 THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE REFLECTED IN MORE THAN ORIENTAL SPLENDOUR
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0009 AND THE PARSEE LIVED BY THE RED SEA WITH NOTHING BUT HIS HAT AND HIS KNIFE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0010 AND A COOKING STOVE OF THE KIND THAT YOU MUST PARTICULARLY NEVER TOUCH
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0011 AND ONE DAY HE TOOK FLOUR AND WATER AND CURRANTS AND PLUMS AND SUGAR AND THINGS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0012 AND MADE HIMSELF ONE CAKE WHICH WAS TWO FEET ACROSS AND
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0013 THREE FEET THICK IT WAS INDEED A SUPERIOR COMESTIBLE THAT'S MAGIC
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0014 AND HE PUT IT ON STOVE BECAUSE HE WAS ALLOWED TO COOK ON THE STOVE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0015 AND HE BAKED IT AND HE BAKED IT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0016 TILL IT WAS ALL DONE BROWN AND SMELT MOST SENTIMENTAL
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0017 BUT JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO EAT IT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0018 THERE CAME DOWN TO THE BEACH FROM THE ALTOGETHER UNINHABITED INTERIOR
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0019 ONE RHINOCEROS WITH A HORN ON HIS NOSE TWO PIGGY EYES
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0020 AND FEW MANNERS IN THOSE DAYS THE RHINOCEROS'S SKIN FITTED HIM QUITE TIGHT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0021 THERE WERE NO WRINKLES IN IT ANYWHERE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0022 HE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE A NOAH'S ARK RHINOCEROS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0023 BUT OF COURSE MUCH BIGGER ALL THE SAME HE HAD NO MANNERS THEN
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0024 AND HE HAS NO MANNERS NOW AND HE NEVER WILL HAVE ANY MANNERS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0025 HE SAID HOW
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0026 AND THE PARSEE LEFT THAT CAKE AND CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A PALM TREE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0027 WITH NOTHING ON BUT HIS HAT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0028 FROM WHICH THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE ALWAYS REFLECTED IN MORE THAN ORIENTAL SPLENDOUR
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0029 AND THE RHINOCEROS UPSET THE OIL STOVE WITH HIS NOSE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0030 AND THE CAKE ROLLED ON THE SAND
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0031 AND HE SPIKED THAT CAKE ON THE HORN OF HIS NOSE AND HE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0032 ATE IT AND HE WENT AWAY WAVING HIS TAIL
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0033 TO THE DESOLATE AND EXCLUSIVELY UNINHABITED INTERIOR
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0034 WHICH ABUTS ON THE ISLANDS OF MAZANDERAN SOCOTRA
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0035 AND PROMONTORIES OF THE LARGER EQUINOX WHICH ABUTS ON THE ISLANDS OF MAZANDERAN
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0036 SOCOTRA AND PROMONTORIES OF THE LARGER EQUINOX THEN
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0037 THE PARSEE CAME DOWN FROM HIS PALM TREE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0038 AND PUT THE STOVE ON ITS LEGS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0039 AND RECITED THE FOLLOWING SLOKA WHICH
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0040 AS YOU HAVE NOT HEARD I WILL NOW PROCEED TO RELATE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0041 THEM THAT TAKES CAKES WHICH THE PARSEE MAN BAKES MAKES
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0042 DREADFUL MISTAKES AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE IN THAT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0043 THAN YOU WOULD THINK BECAUSE FIVE WEEKS LATER THERE WAS A
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0044 HEAT WAVE IN THE RED SEA
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0045 AND EVERYBODY TOOK OFF ALL THE CLOTHES THEY HAD
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0046 THE PARSEE TOOK OFF HIS HAT BUT THE RHINOCEROS TOOK OFF HIS SKIN
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0047 AND CARRIED IT OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE CAME DOWN TO THE BEACH TO BATHE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0048 IN THOSE DAYS IT BUTTONED UNDERNEATH WITH THREE BUTTONS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0049 AND LOOKED LIKE A WATERPROOF HE SAID NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0050 THE PARSEE'S CAKE BECAUSE HE HAD EATEN IT ALL
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0051 AND HE NEVER HAD ANY MANNERS THEN SINCE OR HENCEFORWARD
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0052 HE WADDLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER AND BLEW BUBBLES THROUGH HIS NOSE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0053 LEAVING HIS SKIN ON THE BEACH
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0054 PRESENTLY THE PARSEE CAME BY AND FOUND THE SKIN
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0055 AND HE SMILED ONE SMILE THAT RAN ALL ROUND HIS FACE TWO TIMES
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0056 THEN HE DANCED THREE TIMES ROUND THE SKIN AND RUBBED HIS HANDS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0057 THEN HE WENT TO HIS CAMP AND FILLED HIS HAT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0058 WITH CAKE CRUMBS FOR THE PARSEE NEVER ATE ANYTHING BUT CAKE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0059 AND NEVER SWEPT OUT HIS CAMP HE TOOK THAT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0060 SKIN AND HE SHOOK THAT SKIN AND HE SCRUBBED THAT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0061 SKIN AND HE RUBBED THAT SKIN JUST AS FULL OF OLD DRY STALE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0062 TICKLY CAKE CRUMBS AND SOME BURNED CURRANTS AS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0063 EVER IT COULD POSSIBLY HOLD
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0064 THEN HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF HIS PALM TREE AND WAITED FOR THE RHINOCEROS TO COME OUT OF THE WATER
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0065 AND PUT IT ON AND THE RHINOCEROS DID
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0066 HE BUTTONED IT UP WITH THE THREE BUTTONS AND IT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0067 TICKLED LIKE CAKE CRUMBS IN BED
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0068 THEN HE WANTED TO SCRATCH BUT THAT MADE IT WORSE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0069 AND THEN HE LAY DOWN ON THE SANDS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0070 AND ROLLED AND ROLLED AND ROLLED AND EVERY TIME HE ROLLED
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0071 THE CAKE CRUMBS TICKLED HIM WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0072 THEN HE RAN TO THE PALM TREE AND RUBBED AND RUBBED AND RUBBED HIMSELF AGAINST IT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0073 HE RUBBED SO MUCH AND SO HARD
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0074 THAT HE RUBBED HIS SKIN INTO A GREAT FOLD OVER HIS SHOULDERS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0075 AND ANOTHER FOLD UNDERNEATH WHERE THE BUTTONS USED TO BE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0076 BUT HE RUBBED THE BUTTONS OFF
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0077 AND HE RUBBED SOME MORE FOLDS OVER HIS LEGS
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0078 AND IT SPOILED HIS TEMPER
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0079 BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE THE LEAST DIFFERENCE TO THE CAKE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0080 CRUMBS THEY WERE INSIDE HIS SKIN AND THEY TICKLED
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0081 SO HE WENT HOME VERY ANGRY INDEED AND HORRIBLY SCRATCHY
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0082 AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS EVERY RHINOCEROS HAS GREAT FOLDS IN HIS SKIN
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0083 AND A VERY BAD TEMPER ALL ACCOUNT ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THE CAKE
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0084 CRUMBS INSIDE BUT THE PARSEE CAME DOWN FROM HIS PALM TREE WEARING HIS HAT
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0085 FROM WHICH THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE REFLECTED IN MORE THAN ORIENTAL SPLENDOUR
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0086 PACKED UP HIS COOKING STOVE AND WENT AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF OROTAVO
kayray-20070608-rhi-rhi0087 AMYGDALA THE UPLAND MEADOWS OF ANANTARIVO AND THE MARSHES OF SONAPUT

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0087 TILL HE TROD ON WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A LOG OF WOOD
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0088 AT THE VERY EDGE OF THE GREAT GREY GREEN GREASY LIMPOPO RIVER
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0089 ALL SET ABOUT WITH FEVER TREES BUT IT WAS REALLY THE CROCODILE

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0110 THEN THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD GREW ALL BREATHLESS AND PANTED AND KNEELED DOWN ON THE BANK AND SAID

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0116 WHICH UP TO THAT VERY WEEK

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0126 INSTANTLY PULL AS HARD AS EVER YOU CAN
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0127 IT IS MY OPINION THAT YOUR ACQUAINTANCE IN THE LARGE PATTERN LEATHER ULSTER
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0128 AND BY THIS HE MEANT THE CROCODILE
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0129 WILL JERK YOU INTO YONDER LIMPID STREAM
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0130 BEFORE YOU CAN SAY JACK ROBINSON
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0131 THIS IS THE WAY BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKES ALWAYS TALK
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0132 THEN THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD SAT BACK ON HIS LITTLE HAUNCHES AND PULLED AND PULLED AND PULLED
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0133 AND HIS NOSE BEGAN TO STRETCH
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0134 AND THE CROCODILE FLOUNDERED INTO THE WATER MAKING IT ALL
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0135 CREAMY WITH GREAT SWEEPS OF HIS TAIL AND HE PULLED AND PULLED AND PULLED
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0136 AND THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD'S NOSE KEPT ON STRETCHING
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0137 AND THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD SPREAD ALL HIS LITTLE FOUR LEGS AND PULLED AND PULLED AND PULLED
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0138 AND HIS NOSE KEPT ON STRETCHING
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0139 AND THE CROCODILE THRESHED HIS TAIL LIKE AN OAR AND
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0140 HE PULLED AND PULLED AND PULLED
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0141 AND AT EACH PULL THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD'S NOSE GREW LONGER AND LONGER
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0142 AND IT HURT HIM HIJJUS
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0143 THEN THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD FELT HIS LEGS SLIPPING AND HE SAID THROUGH HIS NOSE
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0144 WHICH WAS NOW NEARLY FIVE FEET LONG THIS IS TOO BUTCH FOR BE
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0145a THEN THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0145b CAME DOWN FROM THE BANK AND KNOTTED HIMSELF IN A DOUBLE CLOVE HITCH ROUND THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD'S HIND LEGS AND SAID
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0146 RASH AND INEXPERIENCED TRAVELLER WE WILL NOW SERIOUSLY DEVOTE OURSELVES
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0147 TO A LITTLE HIGH TENSION BECAUSE IF WE DO NOT
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0148 IT IS MY IMPRESSION THAT YONDER SELF PROPELLING MAN OF WAR WITH THE ARMOUR PLATED UPPER DECK

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0150 WILL PERMANENTLY VITIATE YOUR FUTURE CAREER

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0152 ALWAYS TALK SO HE PULLED AND THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD PULLED
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0153 AND THE CROCODILE PULLED
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0154 BUT THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD AND THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE PULLED HARDEST
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0155 AND AT LAST THE CROCODILE LET GO OF THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD'S NOSE WITH A PLOP
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0156 THAT YOU COULD HEAR ALL UP AND DOWN THE LIMPOPO
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0157 THEN THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD SAT DOWN MOST HARD AND SUDDEN
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0158 BUT FIRST HE WAS CAREFUL TO SAY THANK YOU TO
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0159 THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0160 AND NEXT HE WAS KIND TO HIS POOR PULLED NOSE

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0167 SAID THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0168 SOME PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR THEM
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0169 THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD SAT THERE FOR THREE DAYS WAITING FOR HIS NOSE TO SHRINK
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0170 BUT IT NEVER GREW ANY SHORTER AND BESIDES IT MADE HIM SQUINT

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0204 AS HE USED TO DO
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0205 WHEN HE WANTED GRASS HE PLUCKED GRASS UP FROM THE GROUND
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0206 INSTEAD OF GOING ON HIS KNEES AS HE USED TO DO
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0207 WHEN THE FLIES BIT HIM HE BROKE OFF THE BRANCH OF A TREE

kayray-20070611-ele-ele0210 WHEN HE FELT LONELY WALKING THROUGH AFRICA HE SANG TO HIMSELF DOWN HIS TRUNK
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0211 AND THE NOISE WAS LOUDER THAN SEVERAL BRASS BANDS
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0212 HE WENT ESPECIALLY OUT OF HIS WAY TO FIND A BROAD HIPPOPOTAMUS
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0213 SHE WAS NO RELATION OF HIS AND HE SPANKED HER VERY HARD
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0214 TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BI COLOURED PYTHON ROCK SNAKE HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS NEW TRUNK
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0215 THE REST OF THE TIME HE PICKED UP
kayray-20070611-ele-ele0216 THE MELON RINDS THAT HE HAD DROPPED ON HIS WAY TO THE LIMPOPO

kayray-20070611-leo-leo0005 HOW THE LEOPARD GOT HIS SPOTS IN THE DAYS WHEN EVERYBODY STARTED FAIR
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0006 BEST BELOVED THE LEOPARD LIVED IN A PLACE CALLED
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0007 THE HIGH VELDT MEMBER IT WASN'T THE LOW VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0008 OR THE BUSH VELDT OR THE SOUR VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0009 BUT THE SCLUSIVELY BARE HOT SHINY HIGH VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0010 WHERE THERE WAS SAND AND SANDY COLOURED ROCK
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0011 AND SCLUSIVELY TUFTS OF SANDY YELLOWISH GRASS THE GIRAFFE
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0012 AND THE ZEBRA AND THE ELAND AND THE KOODOO AND THE HARTEBEEST LIVED THERE
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0013 AND THEY WERE SCLUSIVELY SANDY YELLOW BROWNISH ALL OVER BUT THE LEOPARD
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0014 HE WAS THE SCLUSIVEST SANDIEST YELLOWISH BROWNEST OF THEM ALL
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0015 A GREYISH YELLOWISH CATTY SHAPED KIND OF BEAST
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0016 AND HE MATCHED THE SCLUSIVELY YELLOWISH GREYISH BROWNISH COLOUR OF THE HIGH VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0017 TO ONE HAIR
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0018 THIS WAS VERY BAD FOR THE GIRAFFE AND THE ZEBRA AND THE REST OF THEM FOR HE WOULD LIE DOWN BY A SCLUSIVELY YELLOWISH GREYISH BROWNISH STONE OR CLUMP OF GRASS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0019 AND WHEN THE GIRAFFE OR THE ZEBRA OR THE ELAND OR THE KOODOO OR THE BUSH BUCK
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0020 OR THE BONTE BUCK CAME BY
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0021 HE WOULD SURPRISE THEM OUT OF THEIR JUMPSOME LIVES
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0022 HE WOULD INDEED AND ALSO THERE WAS AN ETHIOPIAN WITH BOWS AND ARROWS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0023 A SCLUSIVELY GREYISH BROWNISH YELLOWISH MAN HE WAS THEN
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0024 WHO LIVED ON THE HIGH VELDT WITH THE LEOPARD

kayray-20070611-leo-leo0027 AND THE LEOPARD SCLUSIVELY WITH HIS TEETH AND CLAWS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0028 TILL THE GIRAFFE AND THE ELAND AND THE KOODOO AND THE QUAGGA
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0029 AND ALL THE REST OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO JUMP
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0030 BEST BELOVED THEY DIDN'T INDEED AFTER A LONG TIME
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0031 THINGS LIVED FOR EVER SO LONG IN THOSE DAYS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0032 THEY LEARNED TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A LEOPARD OR AN ETHIOPIAN
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0033 AND BIT BY BIT THE GIRAFFE BEGAN IT BECAUSE HIS LEGS WERE THE LONGEST
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0034 THEY WENT AWAY FROM THE HIGH VELDT
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0035 THEY SCUTTLED FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND DAYS TILL THEY CAME TO A GREAT FOREST
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0036 SCLUSIVELY FULL OF TREES AND BUSHES AND STRIPY SPECKLY PATCHY BLATCHY SHADOWS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0037 AND THERE THEY HID
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0038 AND AFTER ANOTHER LONG TIME WHAT WITH STANDING HALF IN THE SHADE AND HALF OUT OF IT AND WHAT WITH
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0039 THE SLIPPERY SLIDY SHADOWS OF THE TREES FALLING ON THEM
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0040 THE GIRAFFE GREW BLOTCHY AND THE ZEBRA GREW STRIPY
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0041 AND THE ELAND AND THE KOODOO GREW DARKER WITH LITTLE WAVY GREY LINES ON THEIR BACKS LIKE BARK ON A TREE TRUNK
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0042 AND SO THOUGH YOU COULD HEAR THEM AND SMELL THEM
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0043 YOU COULD VERY SELDOM SEE THEM
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0044 AND THEN ONLY WHEN YOU KNEW PRECISELY WHERE TO LOOK
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0045 THEY HAD A BEAUTIFUL TIME
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0046 IN THE SCLUSIVELY SPECKLY SPICKLY SHADOWS OF THE FOREST WHILE THE LEOPARD AND THE ETHIOPIAN RAN ABOUT OVER THE SCLUSIVELY GREYISH YELLOWISH REDDISH HIGH VELDT OUTSIDE
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0047 WONDERING WHERE ALL THEIR BREAKFASTS AND THEIR DINNERS AND THEIR TEAS HAD GONE
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0048 AT LAST THEY WERE SO HUNGRY THAT THEY ATE RATS AND BEETLES AND ROCK RABBITS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0049 THE LEOPARD AND THE ETHIOPIAN AND THEN THEY HAD THE BIG TUMMY ACHE
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0050 BOTH TOGETHER AND THEN THEY MET BAVIAAN THE DOG HEADED BARKING BABOON
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0051 WHO IS QUITE THE WISEST ANIMAL IN ALL SOUTH AFRICA
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0052 SAID LEOPARD TO BAVIAAN AND IT WAS A VERY HOT DAY
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0053 WHERE HAS ALL THE GAME GONE AND BAVIAAN WINKED HE KNEW
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0054 SAID THE ETHIOPIAN TO BAVIAAN CAN YOU TELL ME THE PRESENT
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0055 HABITAT OF THE ABORIGINAL FAUNA THAT MEANT JUST THE SAME THING
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0056 BUT THE ETHIOPIAN ALWAYS USED LONG WORDS HE WAS A GROWN UP
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0057 AND BAVIAAN WINKED HE KNEW THEN SAID BAVIAAN
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0058 THE GAME HAS GONE INTO OTHER SPOTS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0059 AND MY ADVICE TO YOU LEOPARD IS TO GO INTO OTHER SPOTS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0060 AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND THE ETHIOPIAN SAID
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0061 THAT IS ALL VERY FINE
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0062 BUT I WISH TO KNOW WHITHER THE ABORIGINAL FAUNA HAS MIGRATED
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0063 THEN SAID BAVIAAN THE ABORIGINAL FAUNA HAS JOINED THE ABORIGINAL FLORA
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0064 BECAUSE IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR A CHANGE
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0065 AND MY ADVICE TO YOU ETHIOPIAN
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0066 IS TO CHANGE AS SOON AS YOU CAN
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0067 THAT PUZZLED THE LEOPARD AND THE ETHIOPIAN
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0068 BUT THEY SET OFF TO LOOK FOR THE ABORIGINAL FLORA AND PRESENTLY AFTER EVER SO MANY DAYS
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0069 THEY SAW A GREAT HIGH TALL FOREST FULL OF TREE TRUNKS ALL SCLUSIVELY SPECKLED AND SPROTTLED AND SPOTTLED
kayray-20070611-leo-leo0070 DOTTED AND SPLASHED AND SLASHED AND HATCHED AND CROSS HATCHED WITH SHADOWS

kayray-20070611-leo-leo0077 BUT I CAN'T SEE GIRAFFE THAT'S CURIOUS SAID THE LEOPARD

kenanbit-20130805-onq-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
kenanbit-20130805-rrp-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
kenanbit-20130805-wgl-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
kenanbit-20130805-xhl-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
kenanbit-20140130-itl-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
kenanbit-20140130-kvw-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
kenanbit-20140130-omp-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
kenanbit-20140130-xmv-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
kendallykay-20110524-qyf-a0484 NO SIR EE
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
kfinity-20101222-bkb-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
kfinity-20101222-cgk-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
kfinity-20101222-cgk-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
kfinity-20101222-cgk-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
kfinity-20101222-cgk-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
kfinity-20101222-cgk-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
kfinity-20101222-cgk-a0006 GOD BLESS EM I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
kfinity-20101222-cgk-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
kfinity-20101222-cgk-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
kfinity-20101222-cgk-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
kfinity-20101222-cgk-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0329 AH INDEED
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
kfinity-20101222-czl-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
kfinity-20101222-igi-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
kfinity-20101222-vjn-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
kfinity-20101222-vvm-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
kfinity-20101223-nix-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
kfinity-20101231-ypw-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
kfinity-20110122-rww-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
kfinity-20110920-vck-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
kfinity-20130330-olx-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
kgr-20100820-gax-b0251 HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
kgr-20100820-gax-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
kgr-20100820-gax-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
kgr-20100820-gax-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
kgr-20100820-gax-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
kgr-20100820-gax-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
kgr-20100820-gax-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
kgr-20100820-gax-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
kgr-20100820-gax-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
kgr-20100820-gax-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
khemboy-20090128-hvx-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
khemboy-20090128-lnk-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
khemboy-20090129-gno-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
kirkl66-20120228-dfr-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
klaus-20120711-crf-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
klaus-20120711-crf-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
klaus-20120711-crf-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
klaus-20120711-crf-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
klaus-20120711-crf-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
klaus-20120711-crf-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
klaus-20120711-crf-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
klaus-20120711-crf-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
klaus-20120711-crf-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
klaus-20120711-crf-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
kmitch-20100603-cip-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
kmitch-20100603-ftd-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
kmitch-20100603-gnu-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
kmitch-20100603-jic-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
kmitch-20100603-khg-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
kmitch-20100603-mvo-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
kmitch-20100603-pqs-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
kmitch-20100603-qtr-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
kmitch-20100603-sfu-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0516 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
kmitch-20100603-xmp-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
kmitch-20100603-yum-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
knightroto-20120618-wmx-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS

knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0005 HUXLEY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THE MOST OBVIOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0006 AND THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE HISTORY OF CIVILISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0007 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IS THE WONDERFUL INCREASE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0008 BY THE APPLICATION OF MACHINERY THE IMPROVEMENT OF OLD TECHNICAL PROCESSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0009 AND THE INVENTION OF NEW ONES ACCOMPANIED BY AN EVEN MORE REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0010 OF OLD AND NEW MEANS OF LOCOMOTION AND INTERCOMMUNICATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0011 BY THIS RAPID AND VAST MULTIPLICATION OF THE COMMODITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0012 AND CONVENIENCES OF EXISTENCE THE GENERAL STANDARD OF COMFORT HAS BEEN RAISED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0013 THE RAVAGES OF PESTILENCE AND FAMINE HAVE BEEN CHECKED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0014 AND THE NATURAL OBSTACLES WHICH TIME AND SPACE OFFER TO MUTUAL INTERCOURSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0015 HAVE BEEN REDUCED IN A MANNER AND TO AN EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0016 UNKNOWN TO FORMER AGES THE DIMINUTION OR REMOVAL OF LOCAL IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0017 THE CREATION OF COMMON INTERESTS AMONG THE MOST WIDELY SEPARATED PEOPLES AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0018 THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FORCES OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH AGAINST THOSE OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0019 POLITICAL OR SOCIAL ANARCHY THUS EFFECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0020 HAVE EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE PRESENT AND FUTURE FORTUNES OF MANKIND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0021 THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH MAY BE DIVINED BUT CANNOT AS YET
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0022 BE ESTIMATED AT ITS FULL VALUE THIS REVOLUTION FOR IT IS NOTHING LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0023 IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF MODERN CIVILISATION HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0024 BEEN PRECEDED ACCOMPANIED AND IN GREAT MEASURE CAUSED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0025 BY A LESS OBVIOUS BUT NO LESS MARVELLOUS INCREASE OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0026 ESPECIALLY OF THAT PART OF IT WHICH IS KNOWN AS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0027 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0028 TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THE MATERIAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0029 NOT THAT THE GROWTH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS AN EXCLUSIVE PREROGATIVE OF THE VICTORIAN AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0030 ITS PRESENT STRENGTH AND VOLUME MERELY INDICATE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF A STREAM
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0031 WHICH TOOK ITS RISE ALONGSIDE OF THE PRIMAL FOUNTS OF PHILOSOPHY LITERATURE AND ART
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0032 IN ANCIENT GREECE AND AFTER BEING DAMMED UP FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0033 ONCE MORE BEGAN TO FLOW THREE CENTURIES AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0034 IT MAY BE DOUBTED IF EVEN HANDED JUSTICE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0035 AS FREE FROM FULSOME PANEGYRIC AS FROM CAPTIOUS DEPRECIATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0036 HAS EVER YET BEEN DEALT OUT TO THE SAGES OF ANTIQUITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0037 WHO FOR EIGHT CENTURIES FROM THE TIME OF THALES TO THAT OF GALEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0038 TOILED AT THE FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0039 WITHOUT ENTERING INTO THE DISCUSSION OF THAT LARGE QUESTION IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0040 IS CERTAIN THAT THE LABORS OF THESE EARLY WORKERS IN THE FIELD OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0041 WERE BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL BY THE DECAY AND DISRUPTION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0042 THE CONSEQUENT DISORGANISATION OF SOCIETY AND THE DIVERSION OF MEN'S THOUGHTS FROM SUBLUNARY MATTERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0043 TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0044 SUGGESTED BY CHRISTIAN DOGMA IN THE MIDDLE AGES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0045 AND NOTWITHSTANDING SPORADIC ATTEMPTS TO RECALL MEN TO THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0046 HERE AND THERE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0047 THAT PHYSICAL SCIENCE MADE A NEW START FOUNDING ITSELF AT FIRST
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0048 ALTOGETHER UPON THAT WHICH HAD BEEN DONE BY THE GREEKS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0049 INDEED IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE MEN OF THE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0050 RENAISSANCE THOUGH STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE OLD PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0051 WERE A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY SAW AS MUCH AS THEIR FORERUNNERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0052 HAD DONE THE FIRST SERIOUS ATTEMPTS TO CARRY FURTHER THE UNFINISHED WORK OF ARCHIMEDES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0053 HIPPARCHUS AND PTOLEMY OF ARISTOTLE AND OF GALEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0054 NATURALLY ENOUGH AROSE AMONG THE ASTRONOMERS AND THE PHYSICIANS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0055a FOR THE IMPERIOUS NECESSITY OF SEEKING SOME REMEDY FOR THE PHYSICAL ILLS OF LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0055b HAD INSURED THE PRESERVATION OF MORE OR LESS OF THE WISDOM OF HIPPOCRATES AND HIS SUCCESSORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0056 AND BY A HAPPY CONJUNCTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0057 THE JEWISH AND THE ARABIAN PHYSICIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0058 ESCAPED MANY OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH AT THAT TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0059 BLIGHTED NATURAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD ON THE OTHER HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0060 THE SUPERSTITIOUS HOPES AND FEARS WHICH AFFORDED COUNTENANCE TO ASTROLOGY AND TO ALCHEMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0061 ALSO SHELTERED ASTRONOMY AND THE GERMS OF CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0062 WHETHER FOR THIS OR FOR SOME BETTER REASON THE FOUNDERS OF THE SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE AGES INCLUDED ASTRONOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0063 ALONG WITH GEOMETRY ARITHMETIC AND MUSIC
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0064 AS ONE OF THE FOUR BRANCHES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0065 AND IN THIS RESPECT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0066 IT IS ONLY JUST TO THEM TO OBSERVE THAT THEY WERE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THOSE WHO SIT IN THEIR SEATS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0067 THE SCHOOL MEN CONSIDERED NO ONE TO BE PROPERLY EDUCATED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0068 UNLESS HE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH AT ANY RATE ONE BRANCH OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0069 PHYSICAL SCIENCE WE HAVE NOT EVEN YET REACHED THAT STAGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0070 IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0071 THE MEN OF THE RENAISSANCE COULD SHOW THAT THEY HAD ALREADY PUT OUT TO GOOD INTEREST
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0072 THE TREASURE BEQUEATHED TO THEM BY THE GREEKS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0073 THEY HAD PRODUCED THE ASTRONOMICAL SYSTEM OF COPERNICUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0074 WITH KEPLER'S GREAT ADDITIONS THE ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES AND THE PHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0075 THE MECHANICS OF STEVINUS AND THE DE MAGNETE OF GILBERT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0076 THE ANATOMY OF THE GREAT FRENCH AND ITALIAN SCHOOLS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0077 AND THE PHYSIOLOGY OF HARVEY IN ITALY WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED GREECE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0078 IN THE HEGEMONY OF THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0079 THE ACCADEMIA DEI LYNCEI AND SUNDRY OTHER SUCH ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0080 THE MODELS OF ALL SUBSEQUENT ACADEMIES AND SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0081 HAD BEEN FOUNDED WHILE THE LITERARY SKILL AND BITING WIT OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0082 HAD MADE THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS OF THE DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0083 NOT ONLY INTELLIGIBLE BUT ATTRACTIVE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0084 IN OUR OWN COUNTRY FRANCIS BACON
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0085 HAD ESSAYED TO SUM UP THE PAST OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0086 AND TO INDICATE THE PATH WHICH IT MUST FOLLOW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0087 IF ITS GREAT DESTINIES WERE TO BE FULFILLED AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0088 THOUGH THE ATTEMPT WAS JUST SUCH A MAGNIFICENT FAILURE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM A MAN OF GREAT ENDOWMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0089 WHO WAS SO SINGULARLY DEVOID OF SCIENTIFIC INSIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0090 THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THE WORK ALREADY ACHIEVED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0091 BY THE TRUE INSTAURATORS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0092 YET THE MAJESTIC ELOQUENCE AND THE FERVID VATICINATIONS OF ONE WHO WAS CONSPICUOUS ALIKE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0093 BY THE GREATNESS OF HIS RISE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0094 AND THE DEPTH OF HIS FALL DREW THE ATTENTION OF ALL THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0095 TO THE NEW BIRTH OF TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0096 BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO DISCOVER SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0097 THAT THE NOVUM ORGANUM HAD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0098 ANY DIRECT BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0099 NO DELUSION IS GREATER THAN THE NOTION THAT METHOD AND INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0100 CAN MAKE UP FOR LACK OF MOTHERWIT EITHER IN SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0101 OR IN PRACTICAL LIFE AND IT IS STRANGE THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0102 WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MANKIND BACON SHOULD HAVE DREAMED THAT HIS OR ANY OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0103 VIA INVENIENDI SCIENTIAS WOULD LEVEL MEN'S WITS AND LEAVE LITTLE SCOPE FOR THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0104 INBORN CAPACITY WHICH IS CALLED GENIUS AS A MATTER OF FACT BACON'S VIA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0105 HAS PROVED HOPELESSLY IMPRACTICABLE WHILE THE ANTICIPATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0106 BY THE INVENTION OF HYPOTHESES BASED ON INCOMPLETE INDUCTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0107 WHICH HE SPECIALLY CONDEMNS HAS PROVED ITSELF TO BE A MOST EFFICIENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0108 INDEED AN INDISPENSABLE INSTRUMENT OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS FINALLY THAT TRANSCENDENTAL ALCHEMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0109 THE SUPERINDUCEMENT OF NEW FORMS ON MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0110 WHICH BACON DECLARES TO BE THE SUPREME AIM OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0111 HAS BEEN WHOLLY IGNORED BY THOSE WHO HAVE CREATED THE PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0112 OF THE PRESENT DAY EVEN THE ELOQUENT ADVOCACY OF THE CHANCELLOR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0113 BROUGHT NO UNMIXED GOOD TO PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0114 IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH THAT THE MAN WHO IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS TOOK
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0115 ALL KNOWLEDGE FOR HIS PATRIMONY BUT IN HIS WORSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0116 SOLD THAT BIRTHRIGHT FOR THE MESS OF POTTAGE OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0117 COURT FAVOR AND PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS FOR POMP AND SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0118 SHOULD BE LED TO ATTACH AN UNDUE VALUE TO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0119 THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES WHICH HE FORESAW AS ROGER BACON AND INDEED SENECA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0120 HAD FORESEEN LONG BEFORE HIS TIME MUST FOLLOW IN THE TRAIN OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0121a THE BURDEN OF BACON'S PLEADINGS FOR SCIENCE IS THE GATHERING OF FRUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0121b THE IMPORTANCE OF WINNING SOLID MATERIAL ADVANTAGES BY THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0122 AND THE DESIRABLENESS OF LIMITING THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC METHODS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0123 OF INQUIRY TO THAT FIELD BACON'S YOUNGER CONTEMPORARY HOBBES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0124 CASTING ASIDE THE PRUDENT RESERVE OF HIS PREDECESSOR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0125 IN REGARD TO THOSE MATTERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0126 ABOUT WHICH THE CROWN OR THE CHURCH MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY EXTENDED SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF INQUIRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0127 TO THE PHENOMENA OF MIND AND THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0128 WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE INDICATED THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE PROVINCE OF REAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0129 AND THAT OF IMAGINARY KNOWLEDGE THE PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE LEVIATHAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0130 EMBODY A COHERENT SYSTEM OF PURELY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0131 IN LANGUAGE WHICH IS A MODEL OF CLEAR AND VIGOROUS ENGLISH STYLE AT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0132 THE SAME TIME IN FRANCE A MAN OF FAR GREATER SCIENTIFIC CAPACITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0133 THAN EITHER BACON OR HOBBES RENE DESCARTES NOT ONLY IN HIS IMMORTAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0134 DISCOURS DE LA METHODE AND ELSEWHERE WENT DOWN TO THE FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0135 BUT IN HIS PRINCIPES DE PHILOSOPHIE INDICATED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0136 WHERE THE GOAL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE REALLY LAY HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0137 DESCARTES WAS AN EMINENT MATHEMATICIAN AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE BENT OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0138 HIS MIND LED HIM TO OVERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING FROM GENERAL PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0139 AS MUCH AS BACON HAD UNDERESTIMATED IT THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0140 HAS BEEN EFFECTED NEITHER BY BACONIANS NOR BY CARTESIANS AS SUCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0141 BUT BY MEN LIKE GALILEO AND HARVEY BOYLE AND NEWTON WHO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0142 WOULD HAVE DONE THEIR WORK JUST AS WELL IF NEITHER BACON NOR DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0143 HAD EVER PROPOUNDED THEIR VIEWS RESPECTING THE MANNER IN WHICH SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0144 SHOULD BE PURSUED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0145a THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE DURING THE FIRST CENTURY AFTER BACON'S DEATH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0145b BY MEANS VERIFIED HIS SANGUINE PREDICTION OF THE FRUITS WHICH IT WOULD YIELD
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0146 FOR THOUGH THE REVIVED AND RENEWED STUDY OF NATURE HAD SPREAD AND GROWN TO AN EXTENT WHICH SURPASSED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0147 REASONABLE EXPECTATION THE PRACTICAL RESULTS THE GOOD TO MEN'S ESTATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0148 WERE AT FIRST BY NO MEANS APPARENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0149a SIXTY YEARS AFTER BACON'S DEATH NEWTON HAD CROWNED THE LONG LABORS OF THE ASTRONOMERS AND THE PHYSICISTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0149b BY COORDINATING THE PHENOMENA OF SOLAR MOTION THROUGHOUT THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0150 INTO ONE VAST SYSTEM BUT THE PRINCIPIA HELPED NO MAN TO EITHER WEALTH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0151 OR COMFORT DESCARTES NEWTON AND LEIBNITZ
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0152 HAD OPENED UP NEW WORLDS TO THE MATHEMATICIAN BUT THE ACQUISITIONS OF THEIR GENIUS ENRICHED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0153 ONLY MAN'S IDEAL ESTATE DESCARTES HAD LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF RATIONAL COSMOGONY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0154 AND OF PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY BOYLE HAD PRODUCED MODELS OF EXPERIMENTATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0155 IN VARIOUS BRANCHES OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY PASCAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0156 AND TORRICELLI HAD WEIGHED THE AIR MALPIGHI AND GREW
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0157 RAY AND WILLOUGHBY HAD DONE WORK OF NO LESS IMPORTANCE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0158 BUT WEAVING AND SPINNING WERE CARRIED ON WITH THE OLD APPLIANCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0159 NOBODY COULD TRAVEL FASTER BY SEA OR BY LAND THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0160 AND KING GEORGE COULD SEND A MESSAGE FROM LONDON TO YORK
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0161 NO FASTER THAN KING JOHN MIGHT HAVE DONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0162 METALS WERE WORKED FROM THEIR ORES BY IMMEMORIAL RULE OF THUMB
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0163 AND THE CENTRE OF THE IRON TRADE OF THESE ISLANDS WAS STILL AMONG THE OAK FORESTS OF SUSSEX
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0164 THE UTMOST SKILL OF OUR MECHANICIANS DID NOT GET BEYOND THE PRODUCTION OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0165 A COARSE WATCH THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS ILLUSTRATED BY A
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0166 HOST OF GREAT NAMES IN SCIENCE ENGLISH FRENCH GERMAN AND ITALIAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0167 ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF CHEMISTRY GEOLOGY AND BIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0168 BUT THIS DEEPENING AND BROADENING OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED NEXT TO NO IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL BENEFITS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0169 EVEN IF AT THIS TIME FRANCIS BACON COULD HAVE RETURNED TO THE SCENE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0170 OF HIS GREATNESS AND OF HIS LITTLENESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0171 HE MUST HAVE REGARDED THE PHILOSOPHIC WORLD WHICH PRAISED AND DISREGARDED HIS PRECEPTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0172 WITH GREAT DISFAVOR IF GHOSTS ARE CONSISTENT HE WOULD HAVE SAID
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0173 THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL WASTING THEIR TIME JUST AS GILBERT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0174 AND KEPLER AND GALILEO AND MY WORTHY PHYSICIAN HARVEY DID IN MY DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0175 WHERE ARE THE FRUITS OF THE RESTORATION OF SCIENCE WHICH I PROMISED
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0176 THIS ACCUMULATION OF BARE KNOWLEDGE IS ALL VERY WELL BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0177 CUI BONO NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE IS DOING WHAT I TOLD HIM SPECIALLY TO DO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0178 AND SEEKING THAT SECRET OF THE CAUSE OF FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0179 WHICH WILL ENABLE MEN TO DEAL AT WILL WITH MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0180 AND SUPERINDUCE NEW NATURES UPON THE OLD FOUNDATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0181 BUT A LITTLE LATER THAT GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE BEYOND IMAGINABLE UTILITARIAN ENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0182 WHICH IS THE CONDITION PRECEDENT OF ITS PRACTICAL UTILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0183 BEGAN TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0184 UPON PRACTICAL LIFE AND THE OPERATION OF THAT PART OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0185 WE CALL HUMAN UPON THE REST BEGAN TO CREATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0186 NOT NEW NATURES IN BACON'S SENSE BUT A NEW NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0187 THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH IS DEPENDENT UPON MEN'S EFFORTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0188 WHICH IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEIR WANTS AND WHICH WOULD DISAPPEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0189 IF MAN'S SHAPING AND GUIDING HAND WERE WITHDRAWN EVERY MECHANICAL ARTIFICE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0190 EVERY CHEMICALLY PURE SUBSTANCE EMPLOYED IN MANUFACTURE EVERY ABNORMALLY FERTILE RACE OF PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0191 OR RAPIDLY GROWING AND FATTENING BREED OF ANIMALS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0192 IS A PART OF THE NEW NATURE CREATED BY SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0193 WITHOUT IT THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS OF MODERN EUROPE AND AMERICA
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0194 MUST RETAIN THEIR PRIMITIVE SPARSELY INHABITED AGRICULTURAL OR PASTORAL CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0195 IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR WEALTH AND THE CONDITION OF OUR SAFETY FROM SUBMERGENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0196 BY ANOTHER FLOOD OF BARBAROUS HORDES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0197 IT IS THE BOND WHICH UNITES INTO A SOLID POLITICAL WHOLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0198 REGIONS LARGER THAN ANY EMPIRE OF ANTIQUITY IT SECURES US FROM THE RECURRENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0199 OF THE PESTILENCES AND FAMINES OF FORMER TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0200 IT IS THE SOURCE OF ENDLESS COMFORTS AND CONVENIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0201 WHICH ARE NOT MERE LUXURIES BUT CONDUCE TO PHYSICAL AND MORAL WELL BEING
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0202 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THIS NEW BIRTH OF TIME THIS NEW NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0203 BEGOTTEN BY SCIENCE UPON FACT HAS PRESSED ITSELF DAILY AND HOURLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0204 UPON OUR ATTENTION AND HAS WORKED MIRACLES WHICH HAVE MODIFIED THE WHOLE FASHION
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0205 OF OUR LIVES WHAT WONDER THEN IF THESE ASTONISHING FRUITS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0206 ARE TOO OFTEN REGARDED BY BOTH FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0207 AS THE BE ALL AND END ALL OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0208 WHAT WONDER IF SOME EULOGISE AND OTHERS REVILE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0209 THE NEW PHILOSOPHY FOR ITS UTILITARIAN ENDS AND ITS MERELY MATERIAL TRIUMPHS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0210 IN TRUTH THE NEW PHILOSOPHY DESERVES NEITHER THE PRAISE OF ITS EULOGISTS NOR THE BLAME OF ITS SLANDERERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0211 AS I HAVE POINTED OUT ITS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0212 DISCIPLES WERE GUIDED BY NO SEARCH AFTER PRACTICAL FRUITS DURING THE GREAT PERIOD OF ITS GROWTH AND IT REACHED ADOLESCENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0213 WITHOUT BEING STIMULATED BY ANY REWARDS OF THAT NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0214 THE BARE ENUMERATION OF THE NAMES OF THE MEN WHO
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0215 WERE THE GREAT LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN THE LATTER PART OF THE
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0216 EIGHTEENTH AND THE FIRST DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY OF HERSCHEL
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0217 OF LAPLACE OF YOUNG OF FRESNEL OF OERSTED OF CAVENDISH
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0218 OF LAVOISIER OF DAVY OF LAMARCK OF CUVIER OF JUSSIEU
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0219 OF DECANDOLLE OF WERNER AND OF HUTTON
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0220 SUFFICES TO INDICATE THE STRENGTH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN THE AGE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THAT OF WHICH I HAVE TO TREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0221 BUT OF WHICH OF THESE GREAT MEN CAN IT BE SAID
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0222 THAT THEIR LABORS WERE DIRECTED TO PRACTICAL ENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0223 I DO NOT CALL TO MIND EVEN AN INVENTION OF PRACTICAL UTILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0224 WHICH WE OWE TO ANY OF THEM EXCEPT THE SAFETY LAMP OF DAVY
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0225 WERNER CERTAINLY PAID ATTENTION TO MINING AND I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN JAMES WATT
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0226 BUT THOUGH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE IMPROVEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0227 BY WHICH WATT CONVERTED THE STEAM ENGINE INVENTED LONG BEFORE HIS TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0228 INTO THE OBEDIENT SLAVE OF MAN
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0229 WERE SUGGESTED AND GUIDED BY HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0230 HIS SKILL AS A PRACTICAL MECHANICIAN AND THE EFFICIENCY OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070620-sci-sci0231 BOLTON'S WORKMEN HAD QUITE AS MUCH TO DO WITH THE REALISATION OF HIS PROJECTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0001 IN FACT THE HISTORY OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE TEACHES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0002 AND WE CANNOT TOO CAREFULLY TAKE THE LESSON TO HEART
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0003 THAT THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES ATTAINABLE THROUGH ITS AGENCY NEVER HAVE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0004 BEEN AND NEVER WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY ATTRACTIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0005 TO MEN INSPIRED BY THE INBORN GENIUS OF THE INTERPRETER OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0006 TO GIVE THEM COURAGE TO UNDERGO THE TOILS AND MAKE THE SACRIFICES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0007 WHICH THAT CALLING REQUIRES FROM ITS VOTARIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0008 THAT WHICH STIRS THEIR PULSES IS THE LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0009 AND THE JOY OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSES OF THINGS SUNG BY THE OLD POETS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0010 THE SUPREME DELIGHT OF EXTENDING THE REALM OF LAW AND ORDER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0011 EVER FARTHER TOWARDS THE UNATTAINABLE GOALS OF THE INFINITELY GREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0012 AND THE INFINITELY SMALL BETWEEN WHICH OUR LITTLE RACE OF LIFE IS RUN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0013 IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK THE PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHER SOMETIMES INTENTIONALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0014 MUCH MORE OFTEN UNINTENTIONALLY LIGHTS UPON SOMETHING
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0015 WHICH PROVES TO BE OF PRACTICAL VALUE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0016 GREAT IS THE REJOICING OF THOSE WHO ARE BENEFITED THEREBY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0017 AND FOR THE MOMENT SCIENCE IS THE DIANA OF ALL THE CRAFTSMEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0018 BUT EVEN WHILE THE CRIES OF JUBILATION RESOUND
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0019 AND THIS FLOATSAM AND JETSAM OF THE TIDE OF INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0020 IS BEING TURNED INTO THE WAGES OF WORKMEN AND THE WEALTH OF CAPITALISTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0021 THE CREST OF THE WAVE OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0022 IS FAR AWAY ON ITS COURSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0023a OVER THE ILLIMITABLE OCEAN OF THE UNKNOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0023b FAR BE IT FROM ME TO DEPRECIATE THE VALUE OF THE GIFTS OF SCIENCE TO PRACTICAL LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0024 OR TO CAST A DOUBT UPON THE PROPRIETY OF THE COURSE OF ACTION OF THOSE WHO FOLLOW SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0025 IN THE HOPE OF FINDING WEALTH ALONGSIDE TRUTH OR EVEN WEALTH ALONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0026 SUCH A PROFESSION IS AS RESPECTABLE AS ANY OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0027 AND QUITE AS LITTLE DO I DESIRE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0028 IF INDUSTRY OWES A HEAVY DEBT TO SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0029 IT HAS LARGELY REPAID THE LOAN BY THE IMPORTANT AID WHICH IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0030 HAS IN ITS TURN RENDERED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0031 IN CONSIDERING THE CAUSES WHICH HINDERED THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE SCHOOLS OF ATHENS AND OF ALEXANDRIA
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0032 IT HAS OFTEN STRUCK ME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0033 THAT WHERE THE GREEKS DID WONDERS WAS IN JUST THOSE BRANCHES OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0034 SUCH AS GEOMETRY ASTRONOMY AND ANATOMY WHICH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF VERY CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0035 WITHOUT ANY OR ANY BUT THE SIMPLEST APPLIANCES IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0036 IS A CURIOUS SPECULATION TO THINK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0037 WHAT WOULD HAVE BECOME OF MODERN PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0038 IF GLASS AND ALCOHOL HAD NOT BEEN EASILY OBTAINABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0039 AND IF THE GRADUAL PERFECTION OF MECHANICAL SKILL FOR INDUSTRIAL ENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0040 HAD NOT ENABLED INVESTIGATORS TO OBTAIN AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE COST
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0041 MICROSCOPES TELESCOPES AND ALL THE EXQUISITELY DELICATE APPARATUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0042 FOR DETERMINING WEIGHT AND MEASURE AND FOR ESTIMATING THE LAPSE OF TIME WITH EXACTNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0043 WHICH THEY NOW COMMAND IF SCIENCE HAS RENDERED THE COLOSSAL DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN INDUSTRY POSSIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0044 BEYOND A DOUBT INDUSTRY HAS DONE NO LESS FOR MODERN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0045 AND FOR A GREAT DEAL OF MODERN BIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0046 AND AS THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY HAVE AT LAST
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0047 BEGUN TO BE AWARE THAT THE CONDITION OF SUCCESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0048 IN THAT WARFARE UNDER THE TERMS OF PEACE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0049 WHICH IS KNOWN AS INDUSTRIAL COMPETITION LIES IN THE DISCIPLINE OF THE TROOPS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0050 AND THE USE OF ARMS OF PRECISION JUST AS MUCH AS IT DOES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0051 IN THE WARFARE WHICH IS CALLED WAR THEIR DEMAND FOR THAT DISCIPLINE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0052 WHICH IS TECHNICAL EDUCATION IS REACTING UPON SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0053 IN A MANNER WHICH WILL ASSUREDLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0054 STIMULATE ITS FUTURE GROWTH TO AN INCALCULABLE EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0055 IT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS THAT THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0056 AND OF INDUSTRY ARE IDENTICAL THAT SCIENCE CANNOT MAKE A STEP FORWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0057 WITHOUT SOONER OR LATER OPENING UP NEW CHANNELS FOR INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0058 AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT EVERY ADVANCE OF INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0059 FACILITATES THOSE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS UPON WHICH THE GROWTH OF SCIENCE DEPENDS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0060 WE MAY HOPE THAT AT LAST THE WEARY MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PRACTICAL MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0061 WHO PROFESSED TO DESPISE SCIENCE AND THE HIGH AND DRY PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0062 WHO PROFESSED TO DESPISE PRACTICAL RESULTS IS AT AN END
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0063 NEVERTHELESS THAT WHICH IS TRUE OF THE INFANCY OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN THE GREEK WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0064 THAT WHICH IS TRUE OF ITS ADOLESCENCE IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0065 REMAINS TRUE OF ITS RIPER AGE IN THESE LATTER DAYS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0066 THE GREAT STEPS IN ITS PROGRESS HAVE BEEN MADE ARE MADE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0067 AND WILL BE MADE BY MEN WHO SEEK KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0068 SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CRAVE FOR IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0069 THEY HAVE THEIR WEAKNESSES THEIR FOLLIES THEIR VANITIES AND THEIR RIVALRIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0070 LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0071 BUT WHATEVER BY ENDS MAY MAR THEIR DIGNITY AND IMPEDE THEIR USEFULNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0072 THIS CHIEF END REDEEMS THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0073 FRESNEL AFTER A BRILLIANT CAREER OF DISCOVERY IN SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT REGIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0074 OF PHYSICO MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE DIED AT THIRTY NINE YEARS OF AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0075 THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE OF A LETTER FROM HIM TO YOUNG
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0076 WRITTEN IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR QUOTED BY WHEWELL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0077 SO APTLY ILLUSTRATES THE SPIRIT WHICH ANIMATES THE SCIENTIFIC INQUIRER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0078 THAT I MAY CITE IT FOR A LONG TIME THAT SENSIBILITY OR THAT VANITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0079 WHICH PEOPLE CALL LOVE OF GLORY IS MUNCH BLUNTED IN ME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0080 I LABOR MUCH LESS TO CATCH THE SUFFRAGES OF THE PUBLIC
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0081 THAN TO OBTAIN AN INWARD APPROVAL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0082 WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE MENTAL REWARD OF MY EFFORTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0083 WITHOUT DOUBT I HAVE OFTEN WANTED THE SPUR OF VANITY TO EXCITE ME TO PURSUE MY RESEARCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0084 IN MOMENTS OF DISGUST AND DISCOURAGEMENT BUT ALL THE COMPLIMENTS WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0085 FROM M M ARAGO DE LAPLACE OR BIOT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0086 NEVER GAVE ME SO MUCH PLEASURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0087 AS THE DISCOVERY OF A THEORETICAL TRUTH OR THE CONFIRMATION OF A CALCULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0088 BY EXPERIMENT NOTHING GREAT IN SCIENCE HAS EVER BEEN DONE BY MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0089 WHATEVER THEIR POWERS IN WHOM THE DIVINE AFFLATUS OF THE TRUTH SEEKER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0090 WAS WANTING MEN OF MODERATE CAPACITY HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS BECAUSE IT ANIMATED THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0091 AND MEN OF GREAT NATURAL GIFTS HAVE FAILED ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0092 BECAUSE THEY LACKED THIS ONE THING NEEDFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0093 TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE BUSINESS OF INVESTIGATION PRACTICALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0094 BACON'S NOTION OF ESTABLISHING A COMPANY OF INVESTIGATORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0095 TO WORK FOR FRUITS AS IF THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0096 WERE A KIND OF MINING OPERATION AND ONLY REQUIRED WELL DIRECTED PICKS AND SHOVELS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0097 SEEMS VERY STRANGE IN SCIENCE AS IN ART
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0098 AND AS I BELIEVE IN EVERY OTHER SPHERE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0099 THERE MAY BE WISDOM IN A MULTITUDE OF COUNSELLORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0100 BUT IT IS ONLY IN ONE OR TWO OF THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0101 AND IN SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY AT ANY RATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0102 IT IS TO THAT ONE OR TWO
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0103 THAT WE MUST LOOK FOR LIGHT AND GUIDANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0104 NEWTON SAID THAT HE MADE HIS DISCOVERIES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0105 BY INTENDING HIS MIND ON THE SUBJECT NO DOUBT TRULY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0106 BUT TO EQUAL HIS SUCCESS ONE MUST HAVE THE MIND WHICH HE INTENDED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0107 FORTY LESSER MEN MIGHT HAVE INTENDED THEIR MINDS TILL THEY CRACKED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0108 WITHOUT ANY LIKE RESULT IT WOULD BE IDLE EITHER TO AFFIRM
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0109 OR TO DENY THAT THE LAST HALF CENTURY HAS PRODUCED MEN OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0110 OF THE CALIBRE OF NEWTON
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0111 IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT IT CAN SHOW A FEW CAPACITIES OF THE FIRST RANK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0112 COMPETENT NOT ONLY TO DEAL PROFITABLY WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0113 THE INHERITANCE BEQUEATHED BY THEIR SCIENTIFIC FOREFATHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0114 BUT TO PASS ON TO THEIR SUCCESSORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0115 PHYSICAL TRUTHS OF A HIGHER ORDER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0116 THAN ANY YET REACHED BY THE HUMAN RACE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0117 AND IF THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED AS NEWTON SUCCEEDED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0118 IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOUGHT TRUTH AS HE SOUGHT IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0119 WITH NO OTHER OBJECT THAN THE FINDING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0120 I AM CONSCIOUS THAT IN UNDERTAKING TO GIVE EVEN THE BRIEFEST SKETCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0121 OF THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN ALL ITS BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0122 DURING THE LAST HALF CENTURY I MAY BE THOUGHT TO HAVE EXHIBITED MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0123 COURAGE THAN DISCRETION AND PERHAPS MORE PRESUMPTION THAN EITHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0124 SO FAR AS PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS CONCERNED THE DAYS OF ADMIRABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0125 CRICHTONS HAVE LONG BEEN OVER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0126 AND THE MOST INDEFATIGABLE OF HARD WORKERS MAY THINK HE HAS DONE WELL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0127 IF HE HAS MASTERED ONE OF ITS MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0128 NEVERTHELESS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0129 WHO HAS FAMILIARISED HIMSELF WITH THE OPERATIONS OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0130 IN ONE DEPARTMENT TO COMPREHEND THE SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0131 AND EVEN TO FORM A GENERAL ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0132 THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF SPECIALISTS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS NOR IS THEIR ANY LACK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0133 EITHER OF GUIDANCE OR OF AIDS TO IGNORANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0134 BY A HAPPY CHANCE THE FIRST EDITION OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0135 WHEWELL'S HISTORY OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0136 IT AFFORDS A VERY USEFUL VIEW OF THE STATE OF THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0137 AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE VICTORIAN EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0138 AS TO SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXCELLENT SUMMARIES OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0139 THE PROGRESS OF VARIOUS BRANCHES OF SCIENCE ESPECIALLY UP TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0140 WHICH WAS THE JUBILEE YEAR OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0141 AND WITH RESPECT TO THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0142 WITH SOME PARTS OF WHICH MY STUDIES HAVE FAMILIARISED ME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0143 MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE NEARLY COINCIDES WITH THE PRECEDING HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0144 I MAY HOPE THEREFORE THAT MY CHANCE OF ESCAPING SERIOUS ERRORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0145 IS AS GOOD AS THAT OF ANYONE ELSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0146 WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERSUADED TO UNDERTAKE THE SOMEWHAT PERILOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0147 ENTERPRISE IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF ENGAGED THERE IS YET ANOTHER PREFATORY REMARK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0148 WHICH IT SEEMS DESIRABLE I SHOULD MAKE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0149 IT IS THAT I THINK IT PROPER TO CONFINE MYSELF TO THE WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0150 DONE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE DOERS OF IT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0151 MEDDLING WITH QUESTIONS OF MERIT AND PRIORITY IS A THORNY BUSINESS AT THE BEST OF TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0152 AND UNLESS IN CASE OF NECESSITY ALTOGETHER UNDESIRABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0153 WHEN ONE IS DEALING WITH CONTEMPORARIES NO SUCH NECESSITY LIES UPON ME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0154 AND I SHALL THEREFORE MENTION NO NAMES OF LIVING MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0155 LEST PERCHANCE I SHOULD INCUR THE REPROOF WHICH THE ISRAELITES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0156 WHO STRUGGLED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE FIELD ADDRESSED TO MOSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0157 WHO MADE THEE A PRINCE AND A JUDGE OVER US
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0158 PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS ONE AND INDIVISIBLE ALTHOUGH FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES IT IS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0159 CONVENIENT TO MARK IT OUT INTO THE PRIMARY REGIONS OF PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0160 CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY AND TO SUBDIVIDE THESE INTO SUBORDINATE PROVINCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0161 YET THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION AND THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF THE PHYSICAL INQUIRER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0162 ARE EVERYWHERE THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0163 THE OBJECT IS THE DISCOVERY OF THE RATIONAL ORDER WHICH PERVADES THE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0164 THE METHOD CONSISTS OF OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0165 WHICH IS OBSERVATION UNDER ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0166 THE DETERMINATION OF THE FACTS OF NATURE OF INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE REASONING
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0167 FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONS AND CONNECTION THE VARIOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0168 BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DIFFER IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT OF THEIR HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0169 OBSERVATION ON THE ONE HAND OR RATIOCINATION ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0170 IS THEIR MORE OBVIOUS FEATURE BUT IN NO OTHER WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0171 AND NOTHING CAN BE MORE INCORRECT THAN THE ASSUMPTION ONE SOMETIMES MEETS WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0172 THAT PHYSICS HAS ONE METHOD CHEMISTRY ANOTHER AND BIOLOGY A THIRD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0173 ALL PHYSICAL SCIENCE STARTS FROM CERTAIN POSTULATES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0174 ONE OF THEM IS THE OBJECTIVE EXISTENCE OF A MATERIAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0175 IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE PHENOMENA WHICH ARE COMPREHENDED UNDER THIS NAME
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0176 HAVE A SUBSTRATUM OF EXTENDED IMPENETRABLE MOBILE SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0177 WHICH EXHIBITS THE QUALITY KNOWN AS INERTIA AND IS TERMED MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0178 I AM AWARE THAT THIS PROPOSITION MAY BE CHALLENGED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0179 IT MAY BE SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF BOSCOVICH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0180 MATTER HAS NO EXTENSION BEING REDUCED TO MATHEMATICAL POINTS SERVING AS CENTRES OF FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0181 BUT AS THE FORCES OF THE VARIOUS CENTRES ARE CONCEIVED TO LIMIT ONE ANOTHER'S ACTION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0182 IN SUCH A MANNER THAT AN AREA AROUND EACH CENTRE HAS AN INDIVIDUALITY OF ITS OWN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0183 EXTENSION COMES BACK IN THE FORM OF THAT AREA
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0184 AGAIN A VERY EMINENT MATHEMATICIAN AND PHYSICIST THE LATE CLERK MAXWELL
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0185 HAS DECLARED THAT IMPENETRABILITY IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO OUR NOTIONS OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0186 AND THAT TWO ATOMS MAY CONCEIVABLY OCCUPY THE SAME SPACE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0187 I AM LOTH TO DISPUTE ANY DICTUM OF A PHILOSOPHER AS REMARKABLE FOR THE SUBTLETY OF HIS INTELLECT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0188 AS FOR HIS VAST KNOWLEDGE BUT THE ASSERTION THAT ONE AND THE SAME POINT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0189 OR AREA OF SPACE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT CONCEIVABLY OPPOSITE ATTRIBUTES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0190 APPEARS TO ME TO VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTRADICTION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0191 WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION NOT ONLY OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0192 BUT OF LOGIC IN GENERAL IT MEANS THAT A
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0193 CAN NOT BE NOT A ANOTHER POSTULATE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0194 IS THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE LAW OF CAUSATION THAT NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT A CAUSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0195 THAT IS A NECESSARY PRECEDENT CONDITION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0196 THAT THE STATE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0197 IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF ITS STATE AT ANY PRECEDING MOMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0198 ANOTHER IS THAT ANY OF THE RULES OR SO CALLED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0199 LAWS OF NATURE BY WHICH THE RELATION OF PHENOMENA IS TRULY DEFINED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0200 IS TRUE FOR ALL TIME THE VALIDITY OF THESE POSTULATES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0201 IS A PROBLEM OF METAPHYSICS THEY ARE NEITHER SELF EVIDENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0202 NOR ARE THEY STRICTLY SPEAKING DEMONSTRABLE THE JUSTIFICATION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0203 AS AXIOMS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0204 LIES IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT EXPECTATIONS LOGICALLY BASED UPON THEM ARE VERIFIED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0205 OR AT ANY RATE NOT CONTRADICTED WHENEVER THEY CAN BE TESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0206 BY EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL SCIENCE THEREFORE RESTS ON VERIFIED OR UNCONTRADICTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0207 HYPOTHESES AND SUCH BEING THE CASE IT IS NOT SURPRISING
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0208 THAT A GREAT CONDITION OF ITS PROGRESS HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0209 BEEN THE INVENTION OF VERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0210 IT IS A FAVORITE POPULAR DELUSION THAT THE SCIENTIFIC INQUIRER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0211 IS UNDER A SORT OF MORAL OBLIGATION TO
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0212 ABSTAIN FROM GOING BEYOND THAT GENERALISATION OF OBSERVED FACTS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0213 WHICH IS ABSURDLY CALLED BACONIAN INDUCTION BUT ANYONE WHO IS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0214 PRACTICALLY ACQUAINTED WITH SCIENTIFIC WORK IS AWARE THAT THOSE WHO REFUSE TO GO BEYOND FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0215 RARELY GET AS FAR AS FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0216 AND ANYONE WHO HAS STUDIED THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE KNOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0217 THAT ALMOST EVERY GREAT STEP THEREIN HAS BEEN MADE BY THE ANTICIPATION OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0218 THAT IS BY THE INVENTION OF HYPOTHESES WHICH THOUGH VERIFIABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0219 OFTEN HAD VERY LITTLE FOUNDATION TO START WITH AND
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0220 NOT UNFREQUENTLY IN SPITE OF A LONG CAREER OF USEFULNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0221 TURNED OUT TO BE WHOLLY ERRONEOUS IN THE LONG RUN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0222 THE GEOCENTRIC SYSTEM OF ASTRONOMY WITH ITS ECCENTRICS AND ITS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0223 EPICYCLES WAS AN HYPOTHESIS UTTERLY AT VARIANCE WITH FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0224 WHICH NEVERTHELESS DID GREAT THINGS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0225 KEPLER WAS THE WILDEST OF GUESSERS NEWTON'S CORPUSCULAR THEORY OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0226 WAS OF MUCH TEMPORARY USE IN OPTICS THOUGH NOBODY NOW
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0227 BELIEVES IN IT AND THE UNDULATORY THEORY WHICH HAS SUPERSEDED THE CORPUSCULAR THEORY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0228 AND HAS PROVED ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE OF INSTRUMENTS OF RESEARCH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0229 IS BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0230 THE PROPERTIES OF WHICH ARE DEFINED IN PROPOSITIONS SOME OF WHICH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0231 TO ORDINARY APPREHENSION SEEM PHYSICAL ANTINOMIES IT SOUNDS PARADOXICAL TO SAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0232 THAT THE ATTAINMENT OF SCIENTIFIC TRUTH HAS BEEN EFFECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0233 TO A GREAT EXTENT BY THE HELP OF SCIENTIFIC ERRORS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0234 BUT THE SUBJECT MATTER OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS FURNISHED BY OBSERVATION
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0235 WHICH CANNOT EXTEND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF OUR FACULTIES WHILE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0236 EVEN WITHIN THOSE LIMITS WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ANY OBSERVATION IS ABSOLUTELY EXACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0237 AND EXHAUSTIVE HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT ANY GIVEN GENERALISATION FROM OBSERVATION MAY BE TRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0238 WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR POWERS OF OBSERVATION AT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0239 A GIVEN TIME AND YET TURN OUT TO BE UNTRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0240 WHEN THOSE POWERS OF OBSERVATION ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ENLARGED
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0241 OR TO PUT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0242 A DOCTRINE WHICH IS UNTRUE ABSOLUTELY MAY TO A VERY GREAT EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0243 BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF AN INTERPRETATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH AT A CERTAIN PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0244 THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PLANETS MOVE IN CIRCLES WAS TRUE ENOUGH
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0245 TO SERVE THE PURPOSE OF CORRELATING SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS WERE THEN POSSIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0246 AFTER KEPLER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY MOVE IN ELLIPSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0247 BECAME TRUE ENOUGH IN REGARD TO THE STATE OF OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0248 AT THAT TIME WE SAY STILL THAT THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS ARE ELLIPSES
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0249 BECAUSE FOR ALL ORDINARY PURPOSES THAT IS A SUFFICIENTLY NEAR APPROXIMATION TO THE TRUTH BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0250 THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF A PLANET DESCRIBES NEITHER AN ELLIPSE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0251 OR ANY OTHER SIMPLE CURVE BUT AN IMMENSELY COMPLICATED UNDULATING LINE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0252 IT MAY FAIRLY BE DOUBTED WHETHER ANY GENERALISATION OR HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0253 BASED UPON PHYSICAL DATA IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0254 THE SENSE THAT A MATHEMATICAL PROPOSITION IS SO
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0255 BUT IF ITS ERRORS CAN BECOME APPARENT ONLY OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0256 PRACTICABLE OBSERVATION IT MAY BE JUST AS USEFULLY ADOPTED FOR ONE OF THE SYMBOLS OF THAT ALGEBRA
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0257 BY WHICH WE INTERPRET NATURE AS IF IT WERE ABSOLUTELY TRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0258 END OF SECTION ONE THIS HAS BEEN A LIBRIVOX RECORDING
knotyouraveragejo-20070621-sci-sci0259 ALL LIBRIVOX RECORDINGS ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0001 SECTION TWO OF THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0002 BY T H HUXLEY THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY BRANCH OF PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE PRESENTS THREE STAGES WHICH IN THEIR LOGICAL RELATION ARE SUCCESSIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0003 THE FIRST IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE SENSIBLE CHARACTER AND ORDER OF THE PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0004 THIS IS NATURAL HISTORY IN THE ORIGINAL SENSE OF THE TERM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0005 AND HERE NOTHING BUT OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT AVAIL US
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0006 THE SECOND IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE CONSTANT RELATIONS OF THE PHENOMENA THUS DEFINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0007 AND THEIR EXPRESSION IN RULES OR LAWS THE THIRD IS THE EXPLICATION OF THESE PARTICULAR LAWS BY DEDUCTION FROM THE MOST GENERAL LAWS OF MATTER AND MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0008 THE LAST TWO STAGES CONSTITUTE NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN ITS ORIGINAL SENSE IN THIS REGION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0009 THE INVENTION OF VERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES IS NOT ONLY PERMISSIBLE BUT IS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF PROGRESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0010 HISTORICALLY NO BRANCH OF SCIENCE HAS FOLLOWED THIS ORDER OF GROWTH BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0011 FROM THE DAWN OF EXACT KNOWLEDGE TO THE PRESENT DAY OBSERVATION EXPERIMENT AND SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0012 HAVE GONE HAND IN HAND AND WHENEVER SCIENCE HAS HALTED OR STRAYED FROM THE RIGHT PATH IT HAS BEEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0013 EITHER BECAUSE ITS VOTARIES HAVE BEEN CONTENT WITH MERE UNVERIFIED OR UNVERIFIABLE SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0014 AND THIS IS THE COMMONEST CASE BECAUSE OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT ARE HARD WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0015 WHILE SPECULATION IS AMUSING OR IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE THE ACCUMULATION OF DETAILS OF OBSERVATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0016 HAS FOR A TIME EXCLUDED SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0017 THE PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE SINCE THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT MEN HAVE GRADUALLY LEARNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0018 TO LAY ASIDE THE CONSIDERATION OF UNVERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES TO GUIDE OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT BY VERIFIABLE HYPOTHESES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0019 AND TO CONSIDER THE LATTER NOT AS IDEAL TRUTHS THE REAL ENTITIES OF AN INTELLIGIBLE WORLD BEHIND PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0020 BUT AS A SYMBOLICAL LANGUAGE BY THE AID OF WHICH NATURE CAN BE INTERPRETED IN TERMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0021 APPREHENSIBLE BY OUR INTELLECTS AND IF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0022 ATTAINED DIMENSIONS BEYOND ALL FORMER PRECEDENT AND CAN EXHIBIT ACHIEVEMENTS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN ANY FORMER SUCH PERIOD CAN SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0023 IT IS BECAUSE ABLE MEN ANIMATED BY THE TRUE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT CAREFULLY TRAINED IN THE METHOD OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0024 AND HAVING AT THEIR DISPOSAL IMMENSELY IMPROVED APPLIANCES HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE BOUNDARIES OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0025 IN GREATER NUMBER THAN DURING ANY PREVIOUS HALF CENTURY OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0026 I HAVE SAID THAT OUR EPOCH CAN PRODUCE ACHIEVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE OF GREATER MOMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0027 THAN ANY OTHER HAS TO SHOW ADVISEDLY AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE THREE GREAT PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME WHICH JUSTIFY THE ASSERTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0028 ONE OF THESE IS THAT DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER WHICH FOR WANT OF A BETTER NAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0029 I WILL CALL MOLECULAR THE SECOND IS THE DOCTRINE OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0030 THE THIRD IS THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION EACH OF THESE WAS FORESHADOWED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0031 MORE OR LESS DISTINCTLY IN FORMER PERIODS OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0032 AND SO FAR IS EITHER FROM BEING THE OUTCOME OF PURELY INDUCTIVE REASONING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0033 THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO OVERRATE THE INFLUENCE OF METAPHYSICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0034 AND EVEN OF THEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL THREE THE PECULIAR MERIT OF OUR EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0035 IS THAT IT HAS SHOWN HOW THESE HYPOTHESES CONNECT A VAST NUMBER OF SEEMINGLY INDEPENDENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0036 PARTIAL GENERALISATIONS THAT IT HAS GIVEN THEM THAT PRECISION OF EXPRESSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0037 WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THEIR EXACT VERIFICATION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0038 THAT IT HAS PRACTICALLY PROVED THEIR VALUE AS GUIDES TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW TRUTH ALL THREE DOCTRINES ARE INTIMATELY CONNECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0039 AND EACH IS APPLICABLE TO THE WHOLE PHYSICAL COSMOS BUT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE NATURE OF THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0040 THE FIRST TWO GREW MAINLY OUT OF THE CONSIDERATION OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL PHENOMENA WHILE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0041 THE THIRD IN GREAT MEASURE OWES ITS REHABILITATION IF NOT ITS ORIGIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0042 TO THE STUDY OF BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THIS CENTURY A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT TRUTHS APPLICABLE IN PART
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0043 TO MATTER IN GENERAL AND IN PART
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0044 TO PARTICULAR FORMS OF MATTER HAD BEEN ASCERTAINED BY THE PHYSICISTS AND CHEMISTS THE LAWS OF MOTION OF VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0045 OR MOLAR MATTER HAD BEEN WORKED OUT TO A GREAT DEGREE OF REFINEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0046 AND EMBODIED IN THE BRANCHES OF SCIENCE KNOWN AS MECHANICS HYDROSTATICS AND PNEUMATICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0047 THESE LAWS HAD BEEN SHOWN TO HOLD GOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0048 SO FAR AS THEY COULD BE CHECKED BY OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0049 ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL SUCH MASSES OF MATTER POSSESSED INERTIA AND WERE SUSCEPTIBLE OF ACQUIRING MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0050 IN TWO WAYS FIRSTLY BY IMPACT OR IMPULSE FROM WITHOUT AND SECONDLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0051 BY THE OPERATION OF CERTAIN HYPOTHETICAL CAUSES OF MOTION TERMED FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0052 WHICH WERE USUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE RESIDENT IN THE PARTICLES OF THE MASSES THEMSELVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0053 AND TO OPERATE AT A DISTANCE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO TEND TO DRAW ANY TWO SUCH MASSES TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0054 OR TO SEPARATE THEM MORE WIDELY WITH RESPECT TO THE ULTIMATE CONSTITUTION OF THESE MASSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0055 THE SAME TWO ANTAGONISTIC OPINIONS WHICH HAD EXISTED SINCE THE TIME OF DEMOCRITUS AND OF ARISTOTLE WERE STILL FACE TO FACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0056 ACCORDING TO THE ONE MATTER WAS DISCONTINUOUS AND CONSISTED OF MINUTE INDIVISIBLE PARTICLES OR ATOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0057 SEPARATED BY A UNIVERSAL VACUUM ACCORDING TO THE OTHER IT WAS CONTINUOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0058 AND THE FINEST DISTINGUISHABLE OR IMAGINABLE PARTICLES WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE ATTENUATED GENERAL SUBSTANCE OF THE PLENUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0059 A ROUGH ANALOGY TO THE LATTER CASE WOULD BE AFFORDED BY GRANULES OF ICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0060 DIFFUSED THROUGH WATER TO THE FORMER SUCH GRANULES DIFFUSED THROUGH ABSOLUTELY EMPTY SPACE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0061 THE LATTER PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE CHEMISTS HAD ARRIVED AT SEVERAL VERY IMPORTANT GENERALISATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0062 RESPECTING THOSE PROPERTIES OF MATTER WITH WHICH THEY WERE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0063 HOWEVER PLAINLY PONDERABLE MATTER SEEMED TO BE ORIGINATED AND DESTROYED IN THEIR OPERATIONS THEY PROVED THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0064 AS MASS OR BODY IT REMAINED INDESTRUCTIBLE AND INGENERABLE AND THAT SO FAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0065 IT VARIED ONLY IN ITS PERCEPTIBILITY BY OUR SENSES THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATION FURTHER PROVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0066 THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE CHEMICALLY SEPARABLE KINDS OF MATTER WERE UNALTERABLE BY ANY KNOWN MEANS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0067 EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY MIGHT BE MADE TO CHANGE THEIR STATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0068 FROM SOLID TO FLUID OR VICE VERSA UNLESS THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER KINDS OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0069 AND THAT THE PROPERTIES OF THESE SEVERAL KINDS OF MATTER WERE ALWAYS THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0070 WHATEVER THEIR ORIGIN ALL OTHER BODIES WERE FOUND TO CONSIST OF TWO OR MORE OF THESE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0071 WHICH THUS TOOK THE PLACE OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS FURTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0072 IT WAS PROVED THAT IN FORMING CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS BODIES ALWAYS UNITE IN A DEFINITE PROPORTION BY WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0073 OR IN SIMPLE MULTIPLES OF THAT PROPORTION AND THAT IF ANY ONE BODY WERE TAKEN AS A STANDARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0074 EVERY OTHER COULD HAVE A NUMBER ASSIGNED TO IT AS ITS PROPORTIONAL COMBINING WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0075 IT WAS ON THIS FOUNDATION OF FACT THAT DALTON BASED HIS RE ESTABLISHMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0076 OF THE OLD ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS ON A NEW EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION IT IS OBVIOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0077 THAT IF ELEMENTARY MATTER CONSISTS OF INDESTRUCTIBLE AND INDIVISIBLE PARTICLES EACH OF WHICH CONSTANTLY PRESERVES THE SAME WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0078 RELATIVELY TO ALL THE OTHERS COMPOUNDS FORMED BY THE AGGREGATION OF TWO THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0079 FOUR OR MORE SUCH PARTICLES MUST EXEMPLIFY THE RULE OF COMBINATION IN DEFINITE PROPORTIONS DEDUCED FROM OBSERVATION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0080 THE MEANWHILE THE GRADUAL RECEPTION OF THE UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0081 NECESSITATED THE ASSUMPTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ETHER FILLING ALL SPACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0082 BUT WHETHER THIS ETHER WAS TO BE REGARDED AS A STRICTLY MATERIAL AND CONTINUOUS SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0083 WAS AN UNDECIDED POINT AND HENCE THE REVIVED ATOMISM ESCAPED STRANGLING IN ITS BIRTH FOR IT IS CLEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0084 THAT IF THE ETHER IS ADMITTED TO BE A CONTINUOUS MATERIAL SUBSTANCE DEMOCRITIC ATOMISM IS AT AN END
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0085 AND CARTESIAN CONTINUITY TAKES ITS PLACE THE REAL VALUE OF THE NEW ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0086 DID NOT LIE IN THE TWO POINTS WHICH DEMOCRITUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0087 NAMELY THE INDIVISIBILITY OF THE ATOMS AND THE PRESENCE OF AN INTERATOMIC VACUUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0088 BUT IN THE ASSUMPTION THAT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR MEANS OF ANALYSIS TAKE US
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0089 MATERIAL BODIES CONSIST OF DEFINITE MINUTE MASSES EACH OF WHICH SO FAR AS PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES OF DIVISION GO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0090 MAY BE REGARDED AS A UNIT HAVING A PRACTICALLY PERMANENT INDIVIDUALITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0091 JUST AS A MAN IS THE UNIT OF SOCIOLOGY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL FACT OF HIS DIVISIBILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0092 SO SUCH A MINUTE MASS IS THE UNIT OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE THAT SMALLEST MATERIAL PARTICLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0093 WHICH UNDER ANY GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES ACTS AS A WHOLE MOLECULE WOULD BE THE MORE APPROPRIATE NAME FOR SUCH A PARTICLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0094 UNFORTUNATELY CHEMISTS EMPLOY THIS TERM IN A SPECIAL SENSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0095 AS A NAME FOR AN AGGREGATION OF THEIR SMALLEST PARTICLES FOR WHICH THEY RETAIN THE DESIGNATION OF ATOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0096 THE DOCTRINE OF SPECIFIC HEAT ORIGINATED IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT MEANS THAT THE SAME MASS OF A BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0097 UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES ALWAYS REQUIRES THE SAME QUANTITY OF HEAT TO RAISE IT TO A GIVEN TEMPERATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0098 BUT THAT EQUAL MASSES OF DIFFERENT BODIES REQUIRE DIFFERENT QUANTITIES ULTIMATELY IT WAS FOUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0099 THAT THE QUANTITIES OF HEAT REQUIRED TO RAISE EQUAL MASSES OF THE MORE PERFECT GASES THROUGH EQUAL RANGES OF TEMPERATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0100 WERE INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THEIR COMBINING WEIGHTS THUS A DEFINITE RELATION WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE HYPOTHETICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0101 AND HEAT THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROLYTIC DECOMPOSITION SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A LIKE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0102 CLOSE RELATION BETWEEN THESE UNITS AND ELECTRICITY THE QUANTITY OF ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE COMBINATION OF ANY TWO UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0103 IS SUFFICIENT TO SEPARATE ANY OTHER TWO WHICH ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF SUCH DECOMPOSITION THE PHENOMENA OF ISOMORPHISM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0104 SHOWED A RELATION BETWEEN THE UNITS AND CRYSTALLINE FORMS CERTAIN UNITS ARE THUS ABLE TO REPLACE OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0105 IN A CRYSTALLINE BODY WITHOUT ALTERING ITS FORM AND OTHERS ARE NOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0106 AGAIN THE LAWS OF THE EFFECT OF PRESSURE AND HEAT ON GASEOUS BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0107 THE FACT THAT THEY COMBINE IN DEFINITE PROPORTIONS BY VOLUME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0108 AND THAT SUCH PROPORTION BEARS A SIMPLE RELATION TO THEIR COMBINING WEIGHTS ALL HARMONISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0109 WITH THE DALTONIAN HYPOTHESIS AND LED TO THE BOLD SPECULATION KNOWN AS THE LAW OF AVOGADRO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0110 THAT ALL GASEOUS BODIES UNDER THE SAME PHYSICAL CONDITIONS CONTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0111 IN THE FORM IN WHICH IT WAS FIRST ENUNCIATED THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS INCORRECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0112 PERHAPS IT IS NOT EXACTLY TRUE IN ANY FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0113 BUT IT IS HARDLY TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT CHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0114 WOULD NEVER HAVE ADVANCED TO THEIR PRESENT CONDITION UNLESS IT HAD BEEN ASSUMED TO BE TRUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0115 ANOTHER IMMENSE SERVICE RENDERED BY DALTON AS A COROLLARY OF THE NEW ATOMIC DOCTRINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0116 WAS THE CREATION OF A SYSTEM OF SYMBOLIC NOTATION WHICH NOT ONLY MADE THE NATURE OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0117 AND PROCESSES EASILY INTELLIGIBLE AND EASY OF RECOLLECTION BUT BY ITS VERY FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0118 SUGGESTED NEW LINES OF INQUIRY THE ATOMIC NOTATION WAS AS SERVICEABLE TO CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0119 AS THE BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE AND THE CLASSIFICATORY SCHEMATISM OF LINNAEUS WERE TO ZOOELOGY AND BOTANY SIDE BY SIDE WITH THESE ADVANCES AROSE IN ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0120 WHICH ALSO HAS A CLOSE PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0121 IF THE UNIT OF A COMPOUND IS MADE UP BY THE AGGREGATION OF ELEMENTARY UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0122 THE NOTION THAT THESE MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF DEFINITE ARRANGEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0123 INEVITABLY SUGGESTS ITSELF AND SUCH PHENOMENA AS DOUBLE DECOMPOSITION POINTED NOT ONLY TO THE EXISTENCE OF A MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0124 BUT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING A MOLECULAR FABRIC WITHOUT DESTROYING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0125 BY TAKING OUT SOME OF THE COMPONENT UNITS AND REPLACING THEM BY OTHERS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0126 CLASS OF NEUTRAL SALTS FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDES A GREAT NUMBER OF BODIES IN MANY WAYS SIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0127 IN WHICH THE BASIC MOLECULES OR THE ACID MOLECULES MAY BE REPLACED BY OTHER BASIC
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0128 AND OTHER ACID MOLECULES WITHOUT ALTERING THE NEUTRALITY OF THE SALT JUST AS A CUBE OF BRICKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0129 REMAINS A CUBE SO LONG AS ANY BRICK THAT IS TAKEN OUT IS REPLACED BY ANOTHER OF THE SAME SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0130 WHATEVER ITS WEIGHT OR OTHER PROPERTIES MAY BE FACTS OF THIS KIND GAVE RISE TO THE CONCEPTION OF TYPES OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0131 JUST AS THE RECOGNITION OF THE UNITY IN DIVERSITY OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE SPECIES OF PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0132 AND ANIMALS GAVE RISE TO THE NOTION OF BIOLOGICAL TYPES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0133 THE NOTATION OF CHEMISTRY ENABLED THESE IDEAS TO BE REPRESENTED WITH PRECISION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0134 AND THEY ACQUIRED AN IMMENSE IMPORTANCE WHEN THE IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS OF ANALYSIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0135 WHICH TOOK PLACE ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF OUR PERIOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0136 ENABLED THE COMPOSITION OF THE SO CALLED ORGANIC BODIES TO BE DETERMINED WITH RAPIDITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0137 AND PRECISION G AT PRESENT MORE ORGANIC ANALYSES ARE MADE IN A SINGLE DAY THAN WERE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE LIEBIG'S TIME IN A WHOLE YEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0138 A LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE COMPOUNDS CONTAIN NOT MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR ELEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0139 OF WHICH CARBON IS THE CHIEF BUT THEIR NUMBER IS VERY GREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0140 AND THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES IS ASTONISHING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0141 THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE PROPORTION OF EACH ELEMENT IN THESE COMPOUNDS AFFORDS LITTLE OR NO HELP
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0142 TOWARDS ACCOUNTING FOR THEIR DIVERSITIES WIDELY DIFFERENT BODIES BEING OFTEN VERY SIMILAR OR EVEN IDENTICAL IN THAT RESPECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0143 AND IN THE LAST CASE THAT OF ISOMERIC COMPOUNDS THE APPEAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0144 TO DIVERSITY OF ARRANGEMENT OF THE IDENTICAL COMPONENT UNITS WAS THE ONLY OBVIOUS WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0145 HERE AGAIN HYPOTHESIS PROVED TO BE OF GREAT VALUE NOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0146 ONLY WAS THE SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE OF DIVERSITY OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE SUCCESSFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0147 BUT THE STUDY OF THE PROCESS OF TAKING TO PIECES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0148 LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE WAY TO PUT TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0149 AND VAST NUMBERS OF COMPOUNDS SOME OF THEM PREVIOUSLY KNOWN ONLY AS PRODUCTS OF THE LIVING ECONOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0150 HAVE THUS BEEN ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRUCTED CHEMICAL WORK AT THE PRESENT DAY IS TO A LARGE EXTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0151 SYNTHETIC OR CREATIVE THAT IS TO SAY THE CHEMIST DETERMINES THEORETICALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0152 THAT CERTAIN NON EXISTENT COMPOUNDS OUGHT TO BE PRODUCIBLE AND HE PROCEEDS TO PRODUCE THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0153 IT IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OUR EPOCH HAVE PASSED INTO THIS DEDUCTIVE AND SYNTHETIC STAGE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE NAME OF THE NEW CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0154 WHICH THEY COMMONLY RECEIVE BUT THIS NEW CHEMISTRY HAS GROWN UP BY THE HELP OF HYPOTHESES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0155 SUCH AS THOSE OF DALTON AND OF AVOGADRO AND THAT SINGULAR CONCEPTION OF BONDS INVENTED TO COLLIGATE THE FACTS OF VALENCY OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0156 ATOMICITY THE FIRST OF WHICH TOOK SOME TIME TO MAKE ITS WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0157 WHILE THE SECOND FELL INTO OBLIVION FOR MANY YEARS AFTER IT WAS PROPOUNDED FOR LACK OF EMPIRICAL JUSTIFICATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0158 AS FOR THE THIRD IT MAY BE DOUBTED IF ANYONE REGARDS IT AS MORE THAN A TEMPORARY CONTRIVANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0159 BUT SOME OF THESE HYPOTHESES HAVE DONE YET FURTHER SERVICE COMBINING THEM WITH THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0160 AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0161 WHICH ARE ALSO PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME PHYSICISTS HAVE ARRIVED AT AN ENTIRELY NEW CONCEPTION OF THE NATURE OF GASEOUS BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0162 AND OF THE RELATION OF THE PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS OF MATTER TO THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0163 THE CONDUCT OF GASES UNDER VARYING PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE THEIR DIFFUSIBILITY THEIR RELATION TO RADIANT HEAT AND TO LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0164 THE EVOLUTION OF HEAT WHEN BODIES COMBINE THE ABSORPTION OF HEAT WHEN THEY ARE DISSOCIATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0165 AND A HOST OF OTHER MOLECULAR PHENOMENA HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE DEDUCIBLE FROM THE DYNAMICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0166 AND STATICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH APPLY TO MOLAR MOTION AND REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0167 AND THE TENDENCY OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE IS CLEARLY TOWARDS THE REDUCTION OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0168 OF THE INFINITELY LITTLE AS IT ALREADY HAS REDUCED THOSE OF THE INFINITELY GREAT WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0169 TO QUESTIONS OF MECHANICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0170 IN THE MEANTIME THE PRIMITIVE ATOMIC THEORY WHICH HAS SERVED AS THE SCAFFOLDING FOR THE EDIFICE OF MODERN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0171 HAS BEEN QUIETLY DISMISSED I CANNOT DISCOVER THAT ANY CONTEMPORARY PHYSICIST OR CHEMIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0172 BELIEVES IN THE REAL INDIVISIBILITY OF ATOMS OR IN AN INTERATOMIC MATTERLESS VACUUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0173 ATOMS APPEAR TO BE USED AS MERE NAMES FOR PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0174 WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN SUBDIVIDED AND MOLECULES FOR PHYSICO CHEMICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0175 WHICH ARE AGGREGATES OF THE FORMER AND THESE INDIVIDUALISED PARTICLES ARE SUPPOSED TO MOVE IN AN ENDLESS OCEAN OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0176 A VASTLY MORE SUBTLE MATTER THE ETHER IF THIS ETHER IS A CONTINUOUS SUBSTANCE THEREFORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0177 WE HAVE GOT BACK FROM THE HYPOTHESIS OF DALTON TO THAT OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0178 BUT THERE IS MUCH REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE IS GOING TO MAKE A STILL FURTHER JOURNEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0179 AND IN FORM IF NOT ALTOGETHER IN SUBSTANCE TO RETURN TO THE POINT OF VIEW OF ARISTOTLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0180 THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE SO CALLED ELEMENTARY BODIES NOW KNOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0181 HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF OUR EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0182 AND IT HAD BECOME APPARENT THAT THEY WERE BY NO MEANS EQUALLY SIMILAR OR DISSIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0183 BUT THAT SOME OF THEM AT ANY RATE CONSTITUTED GROUPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0184 THE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF WHICH WERE AS MUCH LIKE ONE ANOTHER AS THEY WERE UNLIKE THE REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0185 CHLORINE IODINE BROMINE AND FLUORINE THUS FORMED A VERY DISTINCT GROUP SULPHUR AND SELENIUM ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0186 BORON AND SILICON ANOTHER POTASSIUM SODIUM AND LITHIUM ANOTHER AND SO ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0187 IN SOME CASES THE ATOMIC WEIGHTS OF SUCH ALLIED BODIES WERE NEARLY THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0188 OR COULD BE ARRANGED IN SERIES WITH LIKE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL TERMS IN FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0189 THE ELEMENTS AFFORDED INDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE SUSCEPTIBLE OF A CLASSIFICATION IN NATURAL GROUPS

knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0192 THE SIXTY FIVE OR SIXTY EIGHT RECOGNISED ELEMENTS ARE ARRANGED IN THE ORDER OF THEIR ATOMIC WEIGHTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0193 FROM HYDROGEN THE LIGHTEST AS UNITY TO URANIUM THE HEAVIEST AS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0194 THE SERIES DOES NOT EXHIBIT ONE CONTINUOUS PROGRESSIVE MODIFICATION IN THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERS OF ITS SEVERAL TERMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0195 BUT BREAKS UP INTO A NUMBER OF SECTIONS IN EACH OF WHICH THE SEVERAL TERMS PRESENT ANALOGIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0196 WITH THE CORRESPONDING TERMS OF THE OTHER SERIES THUS THE WHOLE SERIES DOES NOT RUN

knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0201 IN EACH SECTION OF THE SERIES THE ATOMIC WEIGHT IS GREATER THAN IN THE PRECEDING SECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0202 SO THAT IF W IS THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE FIRST SEGMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0203 W PLUS X WILL REPRESENT THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE NEXT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0204 AND W PLUS X PLUS Y THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ANY ELEMENT IN THE NEXT AND SO ON

knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0210 THIS IS A CONCEPTION WITH WHICH BIOLOGISTS ARE VERY FAMILIAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0211 ANIMAL AND PLANT GROUPS CONSTANTLY APPEARING AS SERIES OF PARALLEL MODIFICATIONS OF SIMILAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0212 AND YET DIFFERENT PRIMARY FORMS IN THE LIVING WORLD FACTS OF THIS KIND ARE NOW UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN EVOLUTION FROM A COMMON PROTOTYPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0213 IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT IN THE NOT LIVING WORLD THEY ARE DEVOID OF SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0214 IS IT NOT POSSIBLE NAY PROBABLE THAT THEY MAY MEAN THE EVOLUTION OF OUR ELEMENTS FROM A PRIMARY UNDIFFERENTIATED FORM OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0215 FIFTY YEARS AGO SUCH A SUGGESTION WOULD HAVE BEEN SCOUTED AS A REVIVAL OF THE DREAMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0216 OF THE ALCHEMISTS AT PRESENT IT MAY BE SAID TO BE THE BURNING QUESTION OF PHYSICO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0217 IN FACT THE SO CALLED VORTEX RING HYPOTHESIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND REMARKABLE ATTEMPT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0218 TO DEAL WITH MATERIAL UNITS FROM A POINT OF VIEW WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0219 IT SUPPOSES THE ETHER TO BE A UNIFORM SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0220 AND THAT THE ELEMENTARY UNITS ARE BROADLY SPEAKING PERMANENT WHIRLPOOLS OR VORTICES OF THIS ETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0221 THE PROPERTIES OF WHICH DEPEND ON THEIR ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL MODES OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0222 IT IS CURIOUS AND HIGHLY INTERESTING TO REMARK THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS REMINDS US NOT ONLY OF THE SPECULATIONS OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0223 BUT OF THOSE OF ARISTOTLE THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE VORTEX RINGS TO THE TOURBILLONS OF DESCARTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0224 IS LITTLE MORE THAN NOMINAL BUT THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE MODERN AND THE ANCIENT NOTION OF A DISTINCTION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND DERIVATIVE MATTER IS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0225 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT REAL FOR THIS ETHEREAL URSTOFF OF THE MODERN CORRESPONDS VERY CLOSELY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0226 WITH THE PRHOTE HYLE OF ARISTOTLE THE MATERIA PRIMA OF HIS MEDIAEVAL FOLLOWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0227 WHILE MATTER DIFFERENTIATED INTO OUR ELEMENTS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE FIRST STAGE OF PROGRESS TOWARDS THE HESCHHATE HYLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0228 OR FINISHED MATTER OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY IF THE MATERIAL UNITS OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF NATURE ARE SPECIALISED PORTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0229 OF A RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS MATERIA PRIMA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0230 WHICH WERE ORIGINATED UNDER CONDITIONS THAT HAVE LONG CEASED TO EXIST AND WHICH REMAIN UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGEABLE UNDER ALL CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0231 WHETHER NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL HITHERTO KNOWN TO US IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SPECULATION THAT THEY MAY BE INDEFINITELY ALTERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0232 OR THAT NEW UNITS MAY BE GENERATED UNDER CONDITIONS YET TO BE DISCOVERED IS PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0233 THEORETICALLY AT ANY RATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0234 THE TRANSMUTABILITY OF THE ELEMENTS IS A VERIFIABLE SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS AND SUCH INQUIRIES AS THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN SET AFOOT INTO THE POSSIBLE DISSOCIATIVE ACTION OF THE GREAT HEAT OF THE SUN UPON OUR ELEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0235 ARE NOT ONLY LEGITIMATE BUT ARE LIKELY TO YIELD RESULTS WHICH WHETHER AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0236 WILL BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE IDEA THAT ATOMS ARE ABSOLUTELY INGENERABLE AND IMMUTABLE MANUFACTURED ARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0237 STANDS ON THE SAME SORT OF FOUNDATION AS THE IDEA THAT BIOLOGICAL SPECIES ARE MANUFACTURED ARTICLES STOOD THIRTY YEARS AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0238 AND THE SUPPOSED CONSTANCY OF THE ELEMENTARY ATOMS DURING THE ENORMOUS LAPSE OF TIME MEASURED BY THE EXISTENCE OF OUR UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0239 IS OF NO MORE WEIGHT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE IN THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0240 IN THE INFINITY OF ANTECEDENT TIME THAN THE CONSTANCY OF SPECIES IN EGYPT SINCE THE DAYS OF RAMESES OR CHEOPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0241 IS EVIDENCE OF THEIR IMMUTABILITY DURING ALL PAST EPOCHS OF THE EARTH'S HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0242 IT SEEMS SAFE TO PROPHESY THAT THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE ELEMENTS FROM A PRIMITIVE MATTER WILL IN FUTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0243 PLAY NO LESS A PART IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0244 THAN THE ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS WHICH TO BEGIN WITH HAD NO GREATER IF SO GREAT AN EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0245 IT MAY PERHAPS OCCUR TO THE READER THAT THE BOASTED PROGRESS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DOES NOT COME TO MUCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0246 IF OUR PRESENT CONCEPTIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF MATTER ARE EXPRESSIBLE IN TERMS EMPLOYED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO BY THE OLD MASTER OF THOSE THAT KNOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0247 SUCH A CRITICISM HOWEVER WOULD INVOLVE FORGETFULNESS OF THE FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0248 THAT THE CONNOTATION OF THESE TERMS IN THE MIND OF THE MODERN IS ALMOST INFINITELY DIFFERENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0249 FROM THAT WHICH THEY POSSESSED IN THE MIND OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0250 IN ANTIQUITY THEY MEANT LITTLE MORE THAN VAGUE SPECULATION AT THE PRESENT DAY THEY INDICATE DEFINITE PHYSICAL CONCEPTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0251 SUSCEPTIBLE OF MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT AND GIVING RISE TO INNUMERABLE DEDUCTIONS THE VALUE OF WHICH CAN BE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0252 THE OLD NOTIONS PRODUCED LITTLE MORE THAN FLOODS OF DIALECTICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0253 THE NEW ARE POWERFUL AIDS TOWARDS THE INCREASE OF SOLID KNOWLEDGE EVERYDAY OBSERVATION SHOWS THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0254 OF THE BODIES WHICH COMPOSE THE MATERIAL WORLD SOME ARE IN MOTION AND SOME ARE OR APPEAR TO BE AT REST OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0255 THE BODIES IN MOTION SOME LIKE THE SUN AND STARS EXHIBIT A CONSTANT MOVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0256 REGULAR IN AMOUNT AND DIRECTION FOR WHICH NO EXTERNAL CAUSE APPEARS OTHERS AS STONES AND SMOKE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0257 SEEM ALSO TO MOVE OF THEMSELVES WHEN EXTERNAL IMPEDIMENTS ARE TAKEN AWAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0258 BUT THESE APPEAR TO TEND TO MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE BODIES WE CALL HEAVY SUCH AS STONES DOWNWARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0259 AND THE BODIES WE CALL LIGHT AT LEAST SUCH AS SMOKE AND STEAM UPWARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0260 AND AS WE FURTHER NOTICE THAT THE EARTH BELOW OUR FEET IS MADE UP OF HEAVY MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0261 WHILE THE AIR ABOVE OUR HEADS IS EXTREMELY LIGHT MATTER IT IS EASY TO REGARD THIS FACT AS EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0262 THAT THE LOWER REGION IS THE PLACE TO WHICH HEAVY THINGS TEND THEIR PROPER PLACE IN SHORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0263 WHILE THE UPPER REGION IS THE PROPER PLACE OF LIGHT THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0264 AND TO GENERALISE THE FACTS OBSERVED BY SAYING THAT BODIES WHICH ARE FREE TO MOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0265 TEND TOWARDS THEIR PROPER PLACES ALL THESE SEEM TO BE NATURAL MOTIONS DEPENDENT ON THE INHERENT FACULTIES OR TENDENCIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0266 OF BODIES THEMSELVES BUT THERE ARE OTHER MOTIONS WHICH ARE ARTIFICIAL OR VIOLENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0267 AS WHEN A STONE IS THROWN FROM THE HAND OR IS KNOCKED BY ANOTHER STONE IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0268 IN SUCH CASES AS THESE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A STONE IS CAST FROM THE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0269 THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED BY THE STONE APPEARS TO DEPEND PARTLY ON ITS WEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0270 AND PARTLY UPON THE EXERTION OF THE THROWER SO THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE STONE REMAINING THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0271 IT LOOKS AS IF THE MOTIVE POWER COMMUNICATED TO IT WERE MEASURED BY THE DISTANCE TO WHICH THE STONE TRAVELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0272 AS IF IN OTHER WORDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0273 THE POWER NEEDED TO SEND IT A HUNDRED YARDS WAS TWICE AS GREAT AS THAT NEEDED TO SEND IT FIFTY YARDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0274 THESE APPARENTLY OBVIOUS CONCLUSIONS FROM THE EVERYDAY APPEARANCES OF REST AND MOTION FAIRLY REPRESENT THE STATE OF OPINION UPON THE SUBJECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0275 WHICH PREVAILED AMONG THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND REMAINED DOMINANT UNTIL THE AGE OF GALILEO
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0276 THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRINCIPIA OF NEWTON IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX SEVEN MARKS THE EPOCH AT WHICH THE PROGRESS OF MECHANICAL PHYSICS HAD EFFECTED A COMPLETE REVOLUTION OF THOUGHT ON THESE SUBJECTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0277 BY THIS TIME IT HAD BEEN MADE CLEAR THAT THE OLD GENERALISATIONS WERE EITHER INCOMPLETE OR TOTALLY ERRONEOUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0278 THAT A BODY ONCE SET IN MOTION WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0279 FOR ANY CONCEIVABLE TIME OR DISTANCE UNLESS IT IS INTERFERED WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0280 THAT ANY CHANGE OF MOTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FORCE WHICH CAUSES IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0281 AND TAKES PLACE IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THAT FORCE IS EXERTED AND THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0282 WHEN A BODY IN MOTION ACTS AS A CAUSE OF MOTION ON ANOTHER THE LATTER GAINS AS MUCH AS THE FORMER LOSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0283 AND VICE VERSA IT IS TO BE NOTED HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0284 THAT WHILE IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE ANCIENT IDEA OF THE INHERENT TENDENCY TO MOTION OF BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0285 THE ABSENCE OF ANY SUCH SPONTANEOUS POWER OF MOTION WAS ACCEPTED AS A PHYSICAL AXIOM BY THE MODERNS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0286 THE OLD CONCEPTION VIRTUALLY MAINTAINED ITSELF IS A NEW SHAPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0287 FOR IN SPITE OF NEWTON'S WELL KNOWN WARNING AGAINST THE ABSURDITY OF SUPPOSING THAT ONE BODY CAN ACT ON ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0288 AT A DISTANCE THROUGH A VACUUM THE ULTIMATE PARTICLES OF MATTER WERE GENERALLY ASSUMED TO BE THE SEATS OF PERENNIAL CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0289 OF MOTION TERMED ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES IN VIRTUE OF WHICH ANY TWO SUCH PARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0290 WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL IMPRESSION OF MOTION OR INTERMEDIATE MATERIAL AGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0291 WERE SUPPOSED TO TEND TO APPROACH OR REMOVE FROM ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0292 AND THIS VIEW OF THE DUALITY OF THE CAUSES OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0293 IS VERY WIDELY HELD AT THE PRESENT DAY ANOTHER IMPORTANT RESULT OF INVESTIGATION ATTAINED IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0294 THE PROOF AND QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF PHYSICAL INERTIA IN THE OLD PHILOSOPHY A CURIOUS CONJUNCTION OF ETHICAL AND PHYSICAL PREJUDICES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0295 HAD LED TO THE NOTION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ETHICALLY BAD AND PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCTIVE ABOUT MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0296 ARISTOTLE ATTRIBUTES ALL IRREGULARITIES AND APPARENT DYSTELEOLOGIES IN NATURE TO THE DISOBEDIENCE OR SLUGGISH YIELDING
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0297 OF MATTER TO THE SHAPING AND GUIDING INFLUENCE OF THOSE REASONS AND CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0298 WHICH WERE HYPOTHESIZED IN HIS IDEAL FORMS IN MODERN SCIENCE THE CONCEPTION OF THE INERTIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0299 OR RESISTANCE TO CHANGE OF MATTER IS COMPLEX IN PART IT CONTAINS A COROLLARY FROM THE LAW OF CAUSATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0300 A BODY CANNOT CHANGE ITS STATE IN RESPECT OF REST OR MOTION WITHOUT A SUFFICIENT CAUSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0301 BUT IN PART IT CONTAINS GENERALISATIONS FROM EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0302 ONE OF THESE IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH SUFFICIENT CAUSE RESIDENT IN ANY BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0303 AND THAT THEREFORE IT WILL REST OR CONTINUE IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0304 SO LONG AS NO EXTERNAL CAUSE OF CHANGE ACTS UPON IT THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0305 IS THAT THE EFFECT WHICH THE IMPACT OF A BODY IN MOTION PRODUCES UPON THE BODY ON WHICH IT IMPINGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0306 DEPENDS OTHER THINGS BEING ALIKE ON THE RELATION OF A CERTAIN QUALITY OF EACH WHICH IS CALLED MASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0307 GIVEN A CAUSE OF MOTION OF A CERTAIN VALUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0308 THE AMOUNT OF MOTION MEASURED BY DISTANCE TRAVELLED IN A CERTAIN TIME WHICH IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0309 WILL PRODUCE IN A GIVEN QUANTITY OF MATTER SAY A CUBIC INCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0310 IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME BUT DEPENDS ON WHAT THAT MATTER IS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0311 A CUBIC INCH OF IRON WILL GO FASTER THAN A CUBIC INCH OF GOLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0312 HENCE IT APPEARS THAT SINCE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF MOTION HAVE EX HYPOTHESI BEEN PRODUCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0313 THE AMOUNT OF MOTION IN A BODY DOES NOT DEPEND ON ITS SPEED ALONE BUT ON SOME PROPERTY OF THE BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0314 TO THIS THE NAME OF MASS HAS BEEN GIVEN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0315 SINCE IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT A LARGE QUANTITY OF MATTER MOVING SLOWLY POSSESSES AS MUCH MOTION AS A SMALL QUANTITY MOVING FASTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0316 MASS HAS BEEN HELD TO EXPRESS QUANTITY OF MATTER IT IS FURTHER DEMONSTRABLE THAT AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0317 THE RELATIVE MASS OF ANY TWO BODIES IS EXPRESSED BY THE RATIO OF THEIR WEIGHTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0318 WHEN ALL THESE GREAT TRUTHS RESPECTING MOLAR MOTION OR THE MOVEMENTS OF VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE MASSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0319 HAD BEEN SHOWN TO HOLD GOOD NOT ONLY OF TERRESTRIAL BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0320 BUT OF ALL THOSE WHICH CONSTITUTE THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE AND THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MACROCOSM HAD THUS BEEN EXPRESSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0321 BY A GENERAL MECHANICAL THEORY THERE REMAINED A VAST NUMBER OF PHENOMENA SUCH AS THOSE OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0322 HEAT ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM AND THOSE OF THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES WHICH DO NOT INVOLVE MOLAR MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0323 NEWTON'S CORPUSCULAR THEORY OF LIGHT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH ONE GREAT SERIES OF THESE PHENOMENA ON MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0324 AND IT MAINTAINED ITS GROUND UNTIL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0325 THE UNDULATORY THEORY PROVED ITSELF TO BE A MUCH BETTER WORKING HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0326 HEAT UP TO THAT TIME AND INDEED MUCH LATER WAS REGARDED AS AN IMPONDERABLE SUBSTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0327 CALORIC AS A THING WHICH WAS ABSORBED BY BODIES WHEN THEY WERE WARMED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0328 AND WAS GIVEN OUT AS THEY COOLED AND WHICH MOREOVER WAS CAPABLE OF ENTERING INTO A SORT OF CHEMICAL COMBINATION WITH THEM AND SO BECOMING LATENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0329 RUMFORD AND DAVY HAD GIVEN A GREAT BLOW TO THIS VIEW OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0330 BY PROVING THAT THE QUANTITY OF HEAT WHICH TWO PORTIONS OF THE SAME BODY COULD BE MADE TO GIVE OUT BY RUBBING THEM TOGETHER WAS PRACTICALLY ILLIMITABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0331 THIS RESULT BROUGHT PHILOSOPHERS FACE TO FACE WITH THE CONTRADICTION OF SUPPOSING THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0332 A FINITE BODY COULD CONTAIN AN INFINITE QUANTITY OF ANOTHER BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0333 BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0334 THAT CLEAR AND UNQUESTIONABLE EXPERIMENTAL PROOF WAS GIVEN OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DEFINITE RELATION BETWEEN MECHANICAL WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0335 AND HEAT THAT SO MUCH WORK ALWAYS GIVES RISE UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS TO SO MUCH HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0336 AND SO MUCH HEAT TO SO MUCH MECHANICAL WORK THUS ORIGINATED THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0337 WHICH BECAME THE STARTING POINT OF THE MODERN DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0338 MOLAR MOTION HAD APPEARED TO BE DESTROYED BY FRICTION IT WAS PROVED THAT NO DESTRUCTION TOOK PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0339 BUT THAT AN EXACT EQUIVALENT OF THE ENERGY OF THE LOST MOLAR MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0340 APPEARS AS THAT OF THE MOLECULAR MOTION OR MOTION OF THE SMALLEST PARTICLES OF A BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0341 WHICH CONSTITUTES HEAT THE LOSS OF THE MASSES IS THE GAIN OF THEIR PARTICLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0342 BEFORE EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE HOWEVER THE DOCTRINE OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY HAD BEEN APPROACHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0343 BACON'S CHIEF CONTRIBUTION TO POSITIVE SCIENCE IS THE HAPPY GUESS FOR THE CONTEXT SHOWS THAT IT WAS LITTLE MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0344 THAT HEAT MAY BE A MODE OF MOTION DESCARTES AFFIRMED THE QUANTITY OF MOTION IN THE WORLD TO BE CONSTANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0345 NEWTON NEARLY GAVE EXPRESSION TO THE COMPLETE THEOREM WHILE RUMFORD'S AND DAVY'S EXPERIMENTS SUGGESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0346 THOUGH THEY DID NOT PROVE THE EQUIVALENCY OF MECHANICAL AND THERMAL ENERGY AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0347 THE DISCOVERY OF VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY AND THE MARVELLOUS DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IN THAT FIELD
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0348 EFFECTED BY SUCH MEN AS DAVY FARADAY OERSTED AMPERE AND MELLONI
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0349 HAD BROUGHT TO LIGHT A NUMBER OF FACTS WHICH TENDED TO SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0350 THAT THE SO CALLED FORCES AT WORK IN LIGHT HEAT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0351 CHEMICAL AND IN MECHANICAL OPERATIONS WERE INTIMATELY AND IN VARIOUS CASES QUANTITATIVELY RELATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0352 IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY ONE COULD BE OBTAINED AT THE EXPENSE OF ANY OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0353 AND APPARATUS WAS DEVISED WHICH EXHIBITED THE EVOLUTION OF ALL THESE KINDS OF ACTION FROM ONE SOURCE OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0354 HENCE THE IDEA OF THE CORRELATION OF FORCES WHICH WAS THE IMMEDIATE FORERUNNER OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0355 IT IS A REMARKABLE EVIDENCE OF THE GREATNESS OF THE PROGRESS IN THIS DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0356 WHICH HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN OUR TIME THAT EVEN THE SECOND EDITION OF THE HISTORY OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0357 WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX CONTAINS NO ALLUSION EITHER TO THE GENERAL VIEW OF THE CORRELATION OF FORCES PUBLISHED IN ENGLAND IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0358 TO THE PUBLICATION IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0359 OF THE FIRST OF THE SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS BY WHICH THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT WAS CORRECTLY ASCERTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0360 THIS IS THE MORE CURIOUS AS AMPERE'S HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0361 THAT VIBRATIONS OF MOLECULES CAUSING AND CAUSED BY VIBRATIONS OF THE ETHER CONSTITUTE HEAT IS DISCUSSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0362 WHEWELL REMARKS A PROPOS OF BACON'S DEFINITION OF HEAT THAT IT IS AN EXPANSIVE RESTRAINED MOTION MODIFIED IN CERTAIN WAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0363 AND EXERTED IN THE SMALLER PARTICLES OF THE BODY THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0364 ALTHOUGH THE EXACT NATURE OF HEAT IS STILL AN OBSCURE AND CONTROVERTED MATTER THE SCIENCE OF HEAT NOW CONSISTS OF MANY IMPORTANT TRUTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0365 AND THAT TO NONE OF THESE TRUTHS IS THERE ANY APPROXIMATION IN BACON'S ESSAY IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0366 POINT OF FACT BACON'S STATEMENT HOWEVER MUCH OPEN TO CRITICISM
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0367 DOES CONTAIN A DISTINCT APPROXIMATION TO THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE TRUTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0368 RESPECTING HEAT WHICH HAD BEEN DISCOVERED WHEN WHEWELL WROTE SUCH A FAILURE ON THE PART OF A CONTEMPORARY
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0369 OF GREAT ACQUIREMENTS AND REMARKABLE INTELLECTUAL POWERS TO READ THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0370 IS A LESSON AND A WARNING WORTHY OF BEING DEEPLY PONDERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080426-adv-adv0371 BY ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO PROGNOSTICATE THE COURSE OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS END OF SECTION TWO

knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0001 SECTION THREE OF THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0002 BY T H HUXLEY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0003 I HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE GROWTH OF CLEAR AND DEFINITE VIEWS RESPECTING THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0004 HAS LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0005 SO FAR AS NATURAL AGENCIES ARE CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0006 IT IS INGENERABLE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0007 IN SO FAR AS MATTER MAY BE CONCEIVED TO EXIST IN A PURELY PASSIVE STATE IT IS IMAGINABLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0008 OLDER THAN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0009 BUT AS IT MUST BE ASSUMED TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF MOTION A PARTICLE OF BARE MATTER AT REST MUST BE ENDOWED WITH THE POTENTIALITY OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0010 SUCH A PARTICLE HOWEVER BY THE SUPPOSITION CAN HAVE NO ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0011 FOR THERE IS NO CAUSE WHY IT SHOULD MOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0012 SUPPOSE NOW THAT IT RECEIVES AN IMPULSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0013 IT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE WITH A VELOCITY INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS MASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0014 ON THE ONE HAND AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0015 DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE STRENGTH OF THE IMPULSE ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0016 AND WILL POSSESS KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0017 IN VIRTUE OF WHICH IT WILL NOT ONLY CONTINUE TO MOVE FOR EVER IF UNIMPEDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0018 BUT IF IT IMPINGES ON ANOTHER SUCH PARTICLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0019 IT WILL IMPART MORE OR LESS OF ITS MOTION TO THE LATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0020 LET IT BE CONCEIVED THAT THE PARTICLE ACQUIRES A TENDENCY TO MOVE AND THAT NEVERTHELESS IT DOES NOT MOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0021 IT IS THEN IN A CONDITION TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH IT WAS AT FIRST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0022 A CAUSE COMPETENT TO PRODUCE MOTION IS OPERATING UPON IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0023 BUT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0024 IS UNABLE TO GIVE RISE TO MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0025 IF THE OBSTACLE IS REMOVED THE ENERGY WHICH WAS THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0026 BUT COULD NOT MANIFEST ITSELF AT ONCE GIVES RISE TO MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0027 WHILE THE RESTRAINT LASTS THE ENERGY OF THE PARTICLE IS MERELY POTENTIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0028 AND THE CASE SUPPOSED ILLUSTRATES WHAT IS MEANT BY POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0029 IN THIS CONTRAST OF THE POTENTIAL WITH THE ACTUAL MODERN PHYSICS IS TURNING TO ACCOUNT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0030 THE MOST FAMILIAR OF ARISTOTELIAN DISTINCTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0031 THAT BETWEEN DUNAMIS AND ENERGEIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0032 THAT KINETIC ENERGY APPEARS TO BE IMPARTED BY IMPACT IS A FACT OF DAILY AND HOURLY EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0033 WE SEE BODIES SET IN MOTION BY BODIES ALREADY IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0034 WHICH SEEM TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0035 IT IS A TRUTH WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN LEARNED BY NOTHING BUT EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0036 AND WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0037 BUT MUST BE TAKEN AS AN ULTIMATE FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0038 ABOUT WHICH EXPLICABLE OR INEXPLICABLE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0039 STRICTLY SPEAKING WE HAVE NO DIRECT APPREHENSION OF ANY OTHER CAUSE OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0040 BUT EXPERIENCE FURNISHES INNUMERABLE EXAMPLES OF THE PRODUCTION OF KINETIC ENERGY IN A BODY PREVIOUSLY AT REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0041 WHEN NO IMPACT IS DISCERNIBLE AS THE CAUSE OF THAT ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0042 IN ALL SUCH CASES THE PRESENCE OF A SECOND BODY IS A NECESSARY CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0043 AND THE AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0044 WHICH ITS PRESENCE ENABLES THE FIRST TO GAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0045 IS STRICTLY DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0046 TWO HENCE THE PHRASE ENERGY OF POSITION WHICH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0047 IS FREQUENTLY USED AS EQUIVALENT TO POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0048 IF A STONE IS PICKED UP AND HELD SAY SIX FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0049 IT HAS POTENTIAL ENERGY BECAUSE IF LET GO IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0050 WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO MOVE TOWARDS THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0051 AND THIS ENERGY MAY BE SAID TO BE ENERGY OF POSITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0052 BECAUSE IT DEPENDS UPON THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE EARTH AND THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0053 STONE THE STONE IS SOLICITED TO MOVE BUT CANNOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0054 SO LONG AS THE MUSCULAR STRENGTH OF THE HOLDER PREVENTS THE SOLICITATION FROM TAKING EFFECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0055 THE STONE THEREFORE HAS POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0056 WHICH BECOMES KINETIC IF IT IS LET GO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0057 AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT KINETIC ENERGY WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED BEFORE IT STRIKES THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0058 DEPENDS ON ITS POSITION ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0059 THE FACT THAT IT IS SAY SIX FEET OFF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0060 NEITHER MORE NOR LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0061 MOREOVER IT CAN BE PROVED THAT THE RAISER OF THE STONE HAD TO EXERT AS MUCH ENERGY IN ORDER TO PLACE IT IN ITS POSITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0062 AS IT WILL DEVELOP IN FALLING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0063 HENCE THE ENERGY WHICH WAS EXERTED AND APPARENTLY EXHAUSTED IN RAISING THE STONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0064 IS POTENTIALLY IN THE STONE IN ITS RAISED POSITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0065 AND WILL MANIFEST ITSELF WHEN THE STONE IS SET FREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0066 THUS THE ENERGY WITHDRAWN FROM THE GENERAL STOCK TO RAISE THE STONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0067 IS RETURNED WHEN IT FALLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0068 AND THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0069 ENERGY AS A WHOLE IS CONSERVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0070a TAKING THIS AS A VERY BROAD AND GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE ESSENTIAL FACTS OF THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0070b THE RAISING OF THE STONE IS INTELLIGIBLE ENOUGH AS A CASE OF THE COMMUNICATION OF MOTION FROM ONE BODY TO ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0071 BUT THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF THE RAISED STONE IS NOT SO EASILY INTELLIGIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0072 TO ALL APPEARANCE THERE IS NOTHING EITHER PUSHING OR PULLING IT TOWARDS THE EARTH OR THE EARTH TOWARDS IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0073 AND YET IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE STONE TENDS TO MOVE TOWARDS THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0074 AND THE EARTH TOWARDS THE STONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0075 IN THE WAY DEFINED BY THE LAW OF GRAVITATION IN THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0076 CURRENTLY ACCEPTED LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE THE CAUSE OF MOTION IN ALL SUCH CASES AS THIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0077 WHEN BODIES TEND TO MOVE TOWARDS OR AWAY FROM ONE OR ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0078 WITHOUT ANY DISCERNIBLE IMPACT OF OTHER BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0079 IS TERMED A FORCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0080 WHICH IS CALLED ATTRACTIVE IN THE ONE CASE AND REPULSIVE IN THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0081 AND SUCH ATTRACTIVE OR REPULSIVE FORCES ARE OFTEN SPOKEN OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0082 AS IF THEY WERE REAL THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0083 CAPABLE OF EXERTING A PULL OR A PUSH UPON THE PARTICLES OF MATTER CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0084 THUS THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF THE STONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0085 IS COMMONLY SAID TO BE DUE TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0086 WHICH IS CONTINUALLY OPERATING UPON IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0087 ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION MAY MAKE THE CASE PLAINER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0088 THE BOB OF A PENDULUM SWINGS FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER OF THE CENTRE OF THE ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0089 WHICH IT DESCRIBES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0090 SUPPOSE IT TO HAVE JUST REACHED THE SUMMIT OF ITS RIGHT HAND HALF SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0091 IT IS SAID THAT THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES OF THE BOB FOR THE EARTH AND OF THE EARTH FOR THE BOB
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0092 SET THE FORMER IN MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0093 AND AS THESE FORCES ARE CONTINUALLY IN OPERATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0094 THEY CONFER AN ACCELERATED VELOCITY ON THE BOB UNTIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0095 WHEN IT REACHES THE CENTRE OF ITS SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0096 IT IS SO TO SPEAK FULLY CHARGED WITH KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0097 IF AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE MATERIAL UNIVERSE EXCEPT THE BOB WERE ABOLISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0098 IT WOULD MOVE FOR EVER IN THE DIRECTION OF A TANGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0099 TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ARC DESCRIBED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0100 AS A MATTER OF FACT IT IS COMPELLED TO TRAVEL THROUGH ITS LEFT HAND HALF SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0101 AND THUS VIRTUALLY TO GO UP HILL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0102 CONSEQUENTLY THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES OF THE BOB AND THE EARTH ARE NOW ACTING AGAINST IT AND CONSTITUTE A RESISTANCE WHICH THE CHARGE OF KINETIC ENERGY HAS TO OVERCOME
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0103 BUT AS THIS CHARGE REPRESENTS THE OPERATION OF THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES DURING THE PASSAGE OF THE BOB
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0104 THROUGH THE RIGHT HAND HALF SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0105 DOWN TO THE CENTRE OF THE ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0106 SO IT MUST NEEDS BE USED UP BY THE PASSAGE OF THE BOB
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0107 UPWARDS FROM THE CENTRE OF THE ARC TO THE SUMMIT OF THE LEFT HAND HALF SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0108 HENCE AT THIS POINT THE BOB COMES TO A MOMENTARY REST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0109 THE LAST FRACTION OF KINETIC ENERGY IS JUST NEUTRALISED BY THE ACTION OF THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0110 AND THE BOB HAS ONLY POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0111 EQUAL TO THAT WITH WHICH IT STARTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0112 SO THAT THE SUM OF THE PHENOMENA MAY BE STATED THUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0113 AT THE SUMMIT OF EITHER HALF ARC OF ITS SWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0114 THE BOB HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0115 AS IT DESCENDS IT GRADUALLY EXCHANGES THIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0116 FOR KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0117 UNTIL AT THE CENTRE IT POSSESSES AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0118 FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS IT GRADUALLY LOSES KINETIC ENERGY AS IT ASCENDS UNTIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0119 AT THE SUMMIT OF THE OTHER HALF ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0120 IT HAS ACQUIRED AN EXACTLY SIMILAR AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0121 THUS ON THE WHOLE TRANSACTION NOTHING IS EITHER LOST OR GAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0122 THE QUANTITY OF ENERGY IS ALWAYS THE SAME BUT IT PASSES FROM ONE FORM INTO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0123 TO ALL APPEARANCE THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY THE PENDULUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0124 ARE NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY IMPACT IN FACT IT IS USUALLY ASSUMED THAT CORRESPONDING PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0125 WOULD TAKE PLACE IF THE EARTH AND THE PENDULUM WERE SITUATED IN AN ABSOLUTE VACUUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0126 AND AT ANY CONCEIVABLE DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0127 IF THIS BE SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0128 IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE MUST BE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT KINDS OF CAUSES OF MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0129 THE ONE IMPACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0130 A VERA CAUSA OF WHICH TO ALL APPEARANCE WE HAVE CONSTANT EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0131 THE OTHER ATTRACTIVE OR REPULSIVE FORCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0132 A METAPHYSICAL ENTITY WHICH IS PHYSICALLY INCONCEIVABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0133 NEWTON EXPRESSLY REPUDIATED THE NOTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF ATTRACTIVE FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0134 IN THE SENSE IN WHICH THAT TERM IS ORDINARILY UNDERSTOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0135 AND HE REFUSED TO PUT FORWARD ANY HYPOTHESIS AS TO THE PHYSICAL CAUSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0136 OF THE SO CALLED ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0137 AS A GENERAL RULE HIS SUCCESSORS HAVE BEEN CONTENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0138 TO ACCEPT THE DOCTRINE OF ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES WITHOUT TROUBLING THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH IT INVOLVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0139 BUT THIS HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0140 AND THE ATTEMPT OF LE SAGE IN THE LAST CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0141 TO SHOW THAT THE PHENOMENA OF ATTRACTION AND REPULSION ARE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXPLANATION BY HIS HYPOTHESIS OF BOMBARDMENT BY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0142 ULTRA MUNDANE PARTICLES WHETHER TENABLE OR NOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0143 HAS THE GREAT MERIT OF BEING AN ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF THE DUAL CONCEPTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0144 OF THE CAUSES OF MOTION WHICH HAS HITHERTO PREVAILED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0145 ON THIS HYPOTHESIS THE HAMMERING OF THE ULTRA MUNDANE CORPUSCLES ON THE BOB CONFERS ITS KINETIC ENERGY ON THE ONE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0146 AND TAKES IT AWAY ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0147 AND THE STATE OF POTENTIAL ENERGY MEANS THE CONDITION OF THE BOB DURING THE INSTANT AT WHICH THE ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0148 CONFERRED BY THE HAMMERING DURING THE ONE HALF ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0149 HAS JUST BEEN EXHAUSTED BY THE HAMMERING DURING THE OTHER HALF ARC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0150 IT SEEMS SAFE TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN THE CONCEPTION OF ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0151 HAVING SERVED ITS PURPOSE AS A USEFUL PIECE OF SCIENTIFIC SCAFFOLDING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0152 WILL BE REPLACED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0153 BY THE DEDUCTION OF THE PHENOMENA KNOWN AS ATTRACTION AND REPULSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0154 FROM THE GENERAL LAWS OF MOTION THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0155 DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO ILLUSTRATE IS THUS DEFINED BY THE LATE CLERK MAXWELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0156 THE TOTAL ENERGY OF ANY BODY OR SYSTEM OF BODIES IS A QUANTITY WHICH CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0157 BY ANY MUTUAL ACTION OF SUCH BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0158 THOUGH IT MAY BE TRANSFORMED INTO ANY ONE OF THE FORMS OF WHICH ENERGY IS SUSCEPTIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0159 IT FOLLOWS THAT ENERGY LIKE MATTER IS INDESTRUCTIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0160 AND INGENERABLE IN NATURE THE PHENOMENAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0161 SO FAR AS IT IS MATERIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0162 EXPRESSES THE EVOLUTION AND INVOLUTION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0163 ITS PASSAGE FROM THE KINETIC TO THE POTENTIAL CONDITION AND BACK AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0164 WHEREVER MOTION OF MATTER TAKES PLACE THAT MOTION IS EFFECTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0165 AT THE EXPENSE OF PART OF THE TOTAL STORE OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0166 HENCE AS THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY LIVING BEINGS IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE MATERIAL ARE ALL MOLAR OR MOLECULAR MOTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0167 THESE ARE INCLUDED UNDER THE GENERAL LAW
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0168 A LIVING BODY IS A MACHINE BY WHICH ENERGY IS TRANSFORMED IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0169 THE SAME SENSE AS A STEAM ENGINE IS SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0170 AND ALL ITS MOVEMENTS MOLAR AND MOLECULAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0171 ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0172 BY THE ENERGY WHICH IS SUPPLIED TO IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0173 THE PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH ARISE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0174 ALONG WITH CERTAIN TRANSFORMATIONS OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0175 CANNOT BE INTERPOLATED IN THE SERIES OF THESE TRANSFORMATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0176 INASMUCH AS THEY ARE NOT MOTIONS TO WHICH THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY APPLIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0177 AND FOR THE SAME REASON THEY DO NOT NECESSITATE THE USING UP OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0178 A SENSATION HAS NO MASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0179 AND CANNOT BE CONCEIVED TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF MOVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0180 THAT A PARTICULAR MOLECULAR MOTION DOES GIVE RISE TO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS EXPERIMENTALLY CERTAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0181 BUT THE HOW AND WHY OF THE PROCESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0182 ARE JUST AS INEXPLICABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0183 AS IN THE CASE OF THE COMMUNICATION OF KINETIC ENERGY BY IMPACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0184 WHEN DEALING WITH THE DOCTRINE OF THE ULTIMATE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0185 WE FOUND A CERTAIN RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE OLDEST SPECULATIONS AND THE NEWEST DOCTRINES OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0186 BUT THERE IS NO SUCH RESEMBLANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0187 BETWEEN THE ANCIENT AND MODERN VIEWS OF MOTION AND ITS CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0188 EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THE CONCEPTION OF ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0189 MAY BE REGARDED AS THE MODIFIED DESCENDANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0190 OF THE ARISTOTELIAN CONCEPTION OF FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0191 IN FACT IT IS HARDLY TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT THE ESSENTIAL AND FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANCIENT AND MODERN PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0192 LIES IN THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE TRUE LAWS OF STATICS AND DYNAMICS IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0193 AND IN THE INVENTION OF MATHEMATICAL METHODS OF DEALING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0194 WITH ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE LAWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0195 THE ULTIMATE AIM OF MODERN PHYSICAL SCIENCE IS THE DEDUCTION OF THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY MATERIAL BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0196 FROM PHYSICO MATHEMATICAL FIRST PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0197 WHETHER THE HUMAN INTELLECT IS STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTAIN THE GOAL SET BEFORE IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0198 MAY BE A QUESTION BUT THITHER WILL IT SURELY STRIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0199 THE THIRD GREAT SCIENTIFIC EVENT OF OUR TIME THE REHABILITATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION IS PART OF THE SAME TENDENCY OF INCREASING KNOWLEDGE TO UNIFY ITSELF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0200 WHICH HAS LED TO THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0201 AND THIS TENDENCY AGAIN IS MAINLY A PRODUCT OF THE INCREASING STRENGTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0202 CONFERRED BY PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION ON THE BELIEF IN THE UNIVERSAL VALIDITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0203 OF THAT ORDERLY RELATION OF FACTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0204 WHICH WE EXPRESS BY THE SO CALLED LAWS OF NATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0205 THE GROWTH OF A PLANT FROM ITS SEED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0206 OF AN ANIMAL FROM ITS EGG THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0207 APPARENT ORIGIN OF INNUMERABLE LIVING THINGS FROM MUD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0208 OR FROM THE PUTREFYING REMAINS OF FORMER ORGANISMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0209 HAS FURNISHED THE EARLIER SCIENTIFIC THINKERS WITH ABUNDANT ANALOGIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0210 SUGGESTIVE OF THE CONCEPTION OF A CORRESPONDING METHOD OF COSMIC EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0211 FROM A FORMLESS CHAOS TO AN ORDERED WORLD WHICH MIGHT EITHER CONTINUE FOR EVER OR UNDERGO DISSOLUTION INTO ITS ELEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0212 BEFORE STARTING ON A NEW COURSE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0213 IT IS THEREFORE NO WONDER THAT FROM THE DAYS OF THE IONIAN SCHOOL ONWARDS THE VIEW THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS THE RESULT OF SUCH A PROCESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0214 SHOULD HAVE MAINTAINED ITSELF AS A LEADING DOGMA OF PHILOSOPHY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0215 THE EMANISTIC THEORIES WHICH PLAYED SO GREAT A PART IN NEOPLATONIC PHILOSOPHY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0216 AND GNOSTIC THEOLOGY ARE FORMS OF EVOLUTION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0217 THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY DESCARTES PROPOUNDED A SCHEME OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0218 AS AN HYPOTHESIS OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MODE OF ORIGIN OF THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0219 WHILE PROFESSING TO ACCEPT THE ECCLESIASTICAL SCHEME OF CREATION AS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0220 AN ACCOUNT OF THAT WHICH ACTUALLY WAS ITS MANNER OF COMING INTO EXISTENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0222 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY KANT PUT FORTH A REMARKABLE SPECULATION AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM CLOSELY SIMILAR TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0223 THAT SUBSEQUENTLY ADOPTED BY LAPLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0224 AND DESTINED TO BECOME FAMOUS UNDER THE TITLE OF THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0225 THE CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS AND THE ACUTE REASONINGS OF THE ITALIAN GEOLOGISTS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0226 THE SPECULATIONS OF LEIBNITZ IN THE PROTOGAEA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0227 AND OF BUFFON IN HIS THEORIE DE LA TERRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0228 THE SOBER AND PROFOUND REASONINGS OF HUTTON
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0229 IN THE LATTER PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0230 ALL THESE TENDED TO SHOW THAT THE FABRIC OF THE EARTH ITSELF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0231 IMPLIED THE CONTINUANCE OF PROCESSES OF NATURAL CAUSATION FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0232 A PERIOD OF TIME AS GREAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0233 IN RELATION TO HUMAN HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0234 AS THE DISTANCES OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES FROM US ARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0235 IN RELATION TO TERRESTRIAL STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0236 ABYSS OF TIME BEGAN TO LOOM AS LARGE AS THE ABYSS OF SPACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0237 AND THIS REVELATION TO SIGHT AND TOUCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0238 OF A LINK HERE AND A LINK THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0239 OF A PRACTICALLY INFINITE CHAIN OF NATURAL CAUSES AND EFFECTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0240 PREPARED THE WAY AS PERHAPS NOTHING ELSE HAS DONE FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0241 THE MODERN FORM OF THE ANCIENT THEORY OF EVOLUTION IN THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0242 BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0243 DE MAILLET MADE THE FIRST SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO APPLY THE DOCTRINE TO THE LIVING WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0244 IN THE LATTER PART OF IT ERASMUS DARWIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0245 GOETHE TREVIRANUS AND LAMARCK
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0246 TOOK UP THE WORK MORE VIGOROUSLY AND WITH BETTER QUALIFICATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0247 THE QUESTION OF SPECIAL CREATION OR EVOLUTION LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIERCE DISPUTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0248 WHICH BROKE OUT IN THE FRENCH ACADEMY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0249 BETWEEN CUVIER AND ST HILAIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0250 AND FOR A TIME THE SUPPORTERS OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION WERE SILENCED IF NOT ANSWERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0251 BY THE ALLIANCE OF THE GREATEST NATURALIST OF THE AGE WITH THEIR ECCLESIASTICAL OPPONENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0252 CATASTROPHISM A SHORT SIGHTED TELEOLOGY AND A STILL MORE SHORT SIGHTED ORTHODOXY JOINED FORCES TO CRUSH EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0253 LYELL AND POULETT SCROPE IN THIS COUNTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0254 RESUMED THE WORK OF THE ITALIANS AND OF HUTTON AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0255a THE FORMER AIDED BY A MARVELLOUS POWER OF CLEAR EXPOSITION PLACED UPON AN IRREFRAGABLE BASIS THE TRUTH THAT NATURAL CAUSES ARE COMPETENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0255b TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL EVENTS WHICH CAN BE PROVED TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE COURSE OF THE SECULAR CHANGES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0256 DURING THE DEPOSITION OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0257 THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0258 CONSTITUTED AN EPOCH IN GEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0259 BUT IT ALSO CONSTITUTED AN EPOCH IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF THE DOCTRINES OF EVOLUTION BY RAISING IN THE MIND OF EVERY INTELLIGENT READER THIS QUESTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0260 IF NATURAL CAUSATION IS COMPETENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NOT LIVING PART OF OUR GLOBE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0261 WHY SHOULD IT NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE LIVING PART
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0262 BY KEEPING THIS QUESTION BEFORE THE PUBLIC FOR SOME THIRTY YEARS LYELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0263 THOUGH THE KEENEST AND MOST FORMIDABLE OF THE OPPONENTS OF THE TRANSMUTATION THEORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0264 AS IT WAS FORMULATED BY LAMARCK
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0265 WAS OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SERVICE IN FACILITATING THE RECEPTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0266 OF THE SOUNDER DOCTRINES OF A LATER DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0267 AND IN LIKE FASHION ANOTHER VEHEMENT OPPONENT OF THE TRANSMUTATION OF SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0268 THE ELDER AGASSIZ WAS DOOMED TO HELP THE CAUSE HE HATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0269 AGASSIZ NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THE FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0270 OF THE PROGRESSIVE ADVANCE IN ORGANISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0271 OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH AT EACH SUCCESSIVE GEOLOGICAL EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0272 BUT HE INSISTED UPON THE ANALOGY OF THE STEPS OF THIS PROGRESSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0273 WITH THOSE BY WHICH THE EMBRYO ADVANCES TO THE ADULT CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0274 AMONG THE HIGHEST FORMS OF EACH GROUP
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0275 IN FACT IN ENDEAVORING TO SUPPORT THESE VIEWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0276 HE WENT A GOOD WAY BEYOND THE LIMITS OF ANY CAUTIOUS INTERPRETATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0277 OF THE FACTS THEN KNOWN ALTHOUGH LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0278 WHEWELL SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN PARTICULAR PAINS WITH THAT PART OF HIS WORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0279 WHICH DEALS WITH THE HISTORY OF GEOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0280 AND SEVERAL CHAPTERS OF HIS SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH BOOKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0281 WHICH COMPRISE THE HISTORY OF PHYSIOLOGY OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0282 AND OF THE PALAETIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0283 VIVIDLY REPRODUCE THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE EARLY DAYS OF THE VICTORIAN EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0284 BUT HERE AS IN THE CASE OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0285 THE HISTORIAN OF THE INDUCTIVE SCIENCES HAS NO PROPHETIC INSIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0286 NOT EVEN A SUSPICION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0287 OF THAT WHICH THE NEAR FUTURE WAS TO BRING FORTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0288 AND THOSE WHO STILL REPEAT THE ONCE FAVORITE OBJECTION THAT DARWIN'S ORIGIN OF SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0289 IS NOTHING BUT A NEW VERSION OF THE PHILOSOPHIE ZOOLOGIQUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0290 WILL FIND THAT SO LATE AS EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR WHEWELL HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF DARWIN'S MAIN THEOREM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0291 EVEN AS A LOGICAL POSSIBILITY IN FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0292 THE PUBLICATION OF THAT THEOREM BY DARWIN AND WALLACE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0293 TOOK ALL THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD BY SURPRISE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0294 NEITHER THOSE WHO WERE INCLINED TOWARDS THE PROGRESSIVE TRANSMUTATION OR DEVELOPMENT DOCTRINE AS IT WAS THEN CALLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0295 NOR THOSE WHO WERE OPPOSED TO IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0296 HAD THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0297 THAT THE TENDENCY TO VARIATION IN LIVING BEINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0298 WHICH ALL ADMITTED AS A MATTER OF FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0299 THE SELECTIVE INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0300 WHICH NO ONE COULD DENY TO BE A MATTER OF FACT WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO THE EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0301 AND THE OCCURRENCE OF GREAT GEOLOGICAL CHANGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0302 WHICH ALSO WAS MATTER OF FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0303 COULD BE USED AS THE ONLY NECESSARY POSTULATES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0304 OF A THEORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0305 WHICH EVEN IF NOT AT ONCE COMPETENT TO EXPLAIN ALL THE KNOWN FACTS OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE COULD NOT BE SHOWN TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH ANY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0306 SO FAR AS BIOLOGY IS CONCERNED THE PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0307 FOR THE FIRST TIME PUT THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION IN ITS APPLICATION TO LIVING THINGS UPON A SOUND SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0308 IT BECAME AN INSTRUMENT OF INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0309 AND IN NO HANDS DID IT PROVE MORE BRILLIANTLY PROFITABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0310 THAN IN THOSE OF DARWIN HIMSELF HIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0311 PUBLICATIONS ON THE EFFECTS OF DOMESTICATION IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0312 ON THE INFLUENCE OF CROSS FERTILISATION ON FLOWERS AS ORGANS FOR EFFECTING SUCH FERTILISATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0313 ON INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS ON THE MOTIONS OF PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0314 POINTED OUT THE ROUTES OF EXPLORATION WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN FOLLOWED BY HOSTS OF INQUIRERS TO THE GREAT PROFIT OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0315 DARWIN FOUND THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD A MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FIELD FOR EVEN HIS GREAT POWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0316 AND LEFT THE COSMICAL PART OF THE DOCTRINE TO OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0317 NOT MUCH HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0318 SINCE THE TIME OF LAPLACE EXCEPT THAT THE ATTEMPT TO SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0319 AGAINST THAT HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0320 THAT ALL NEBULAE ARE STAR CLUSTERS HAS BEEN MET BY THE SPECTROSCOPIC PROOF OF THE GASEOUS CONDITION OF SOME OF THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0322 MOREOVER PHYSICISTS OF THE PRESENT GENERATION APPEAR NOW TO ACCEPT THE SECULAR COOLING OF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0323 WHICH IS ONE OF THE COROLLARIES OF THAT HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0324 IN FACT ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE HELP OF DEDUCTIONS FROM THE DATA OF PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0325 TO LAY DOWN AN APPROXIMATE LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF MILLIONS OF YEARS WHICH HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE EARTH WAS HABITABLE BY LIVING BEINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0326 IF THE CONCLUSIONS THUS REACHED SHOULD STAND THE TEST OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION THEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0327 WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE VERY VALUABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0328 BUT WHETHER TRUE OR FALSE THEY CAN HAVE NO INFLUENCE UPON THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0329 ITS APPLICATION TO LIVING ORGANISMS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0330 OCCURRENCE OF SUCCESSIVE FORMS OF LIFE UPON OUR GLOBE IS AN HISTORICAL FACT WHICH CANNOT BE DISPUTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0331 AND THE RELATION OF THESE SUCCESSIVE FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0332 AS STAGES OF EVOLUTION OF THE SAME TYPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0333 IS ESTABLISHED IN VARIOUS CASES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0334 THE BIOLOGIST HAS NO MEANS OF DETERMINING THE TIME OVER WHICH THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION HAS EXTENDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0335 BUT ACCEPTS THE COMPUTATION OF THE PHYSICAL GEOLOGIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0336 AND THE PHYSICIST WHATEVER THAT MAY BE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0337 EVOLUTION AS A PHILOSOPHICAL DOCTRINE APPLICABLE TO ALL PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0338 WHETHER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL WHETHER MANIFESTED BY MATERIAL ATOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0339 OR BY MEN IN SOCIETY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0340 HAS BEEN DEALT WITH SYSTEMATICALLY IN THE SYNTHETIC PHILOSOPHY OF MR HERBERT SPENCER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0341 COMMENT ON THAT GREAT UNDERTAKING WOULD NOT BE IN PLACE HERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0342 I MENTION IT BECAUSE SO FAR AS I KNOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0343 IT IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO DEAL ON SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES WITH MODERN SCIENTIFIC FACTS AND SPECULATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0344 FOR THE PHILOSOPHIC POSITIVE OF M COMTE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0345 WITH WHICH MR SPENCER'S SYSTEM OF PHILOSOPHY IS SOMETIMES COMPARED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0346 THOUGH IT PROFESSES A SIMILAR OBJECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0347 IS UNFORTUNATELY PERMEATED BY A THOROUGHLY UNSCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0348 AND ITS AUTHOR HAD NO ADEQUATE ACQUAINTANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0349 WITH THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES EVEN OF HIS OWN TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0350 THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION SO FAR AS THE PRESENT PHYSICAL COSMOS IS CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0351 POSTULATES THE FIXITY OF THE RULES OF OPERATION OF THE CAUSES OF MOTION IN THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0352 IF ALL KINDS OF MATTER ARE MODIFICATIONS OF ONE KIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0353 AND IF ALL MODES OF MOTION ARE DERIVED FROM THE SAME ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0354 THE ORDERLY EVOLUTION OF PHYSICAL NATURE OUT OF ONE SUBSTRATUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0355 AND ONE ENERGY IMPLIES THAT THE RULES OF ACTION OF THAT ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0356 SHOULD BE FIXED AND DEFINITE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0357 THE PAST HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE BACK TO THAT POINT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0358 THERE CAN BE NO ROOM FOR CHANCE OR DISORDER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0359 BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS UNIVERSE OF SIMPLEST MATTER AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0360 DEFINITELY OPERATING ENERGY WHICH FORMS OUR HYPOTHETICAL STARTING POINT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0361 MAY NOT ITSELF BE A PRODUCT OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0362 FROM A UNIVERSE OF SUCH MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0363 IN WHICH THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ENERGY WERE NOT DEFINITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0364 IN WHICH FOR EXAMPLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0365 OUR LAWS OF MOTION HELD GOOD FOR SOME UNITS AND NOT FOR OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0366 OR FOR THE SAME UNITS AT ONE TIME AND NOT AT ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0367 AND WHICH WOULD THEREFORE BE A REAL EPICUREAN CHANCE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0368 FOR MYSELF I MUST CONFESS THAT I FIND THE AIR OF THIS REGION OF SPECULATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0369 TOO RAREFIED FOR MY CONSTITUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0370 AND I AM DISPOSED TO TAKE REFUGE IN IGNORAMUS ET IGNORABIMUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0371 THE EXECUTION OF MY FURTHER TASK
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0372 THE INDICATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE SEVERAL BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0373 DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0374 IS EMBARRASSED BY THE ABUNDANCE OF THE OBJECTS OF CHOICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0375 AND BY THE DIFFICULTY WHICH EVERYONE BUT A SPECIALIST IN EACH DEPARTMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0376 MUST FIND IN DRAWING A DUE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DISCOVERIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0377 WHICH STRIKE THE IMAGINATION BY THEIR NOVELTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0378 OR BY THEIR PRACTICAL INFLUENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0379 AND THOSE UNOBTRUSIVE BUT PREGNANT OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0380 IN WHICH THE GERMS OF THE GREAT THINGS OF THE FUTURE REALLY LIE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0381 MOREOVER MY LIMITS RESTRICT ME TO LITTLE MORE THAN A BARE CHRONICLE OF THE EVENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0382 WHICH I HAVE TO NOTICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0383 IN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY THE OLD BOUNDARIES OF WHICH SCIENCES ARE RAPIDLY BECOMING EFFACED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0384 ONE CAN HARDLY GO WRONG IN ASCRIBING A PRIMARY VALUE TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0385 THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE RELATION BETWEEN THE SOLID LIQUID AND GASEOUS STATES OF MATTER ON THE ONE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0386 AND DEGREES OF PRESSURE AND OF HEAT ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0387 ALMOST ALL EVEN THE MOST REFRACTORY SOLIDS HAVE BEEN VAPORISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0388 BY THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE ELECTRIC ARC AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0389 THE MOST REFRACTORY GASES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ASSUME THE LIQUID
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0390 AND EVEN THE SOLID FORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0391 BY THE COMBINATION OF HIGH PRESSURE WITH INTENSE COLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0392 IT HAS FURTHER BEEN SHOWN THAT THERE IS NO DISCONTINUITY BETWEEN THESE STATES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0393 THAT A GAS PASSES INTO THE LIQUID STATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0394 THROUGH A CONDITION WHICH IS NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0395 AND THAT A LIQUID BODY BECOMES SOLID
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0396 OR A SOLID LIQUID BY THE INTERMEDIATION OF A CONDITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0397 IN WHICH IT IS NEITHER TRULY SOLID NOR TRULY LIQUID
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0398 THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONCURRED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VIEW THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0399 A GAS IS A BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0400 THE PARTICLES OF WHICH ARE IN INCESSANT RECTILINEAR MOTION AT HIGH VELOCITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0401 COLLIDING WITH ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0402 AND BOUNDING BACK WHEN THEY STRIKE THE WALLS OF THE CONTAINING VESSEL
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0403 AND ON THIS THEORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0404 THE ALREADY ASCERTAINED RELATIONS OF GASEOUS BODIES TO HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0405 AND PRESSURE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE DEDUCIBLE FROM MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0406 IMMENSE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN EFFECTED IN THE MEANS OF EXHAUSTING A GIVEN SPACE OF ITS GASEOUS CONTENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0407 AND EXPERIMENTATION ON THE PHENOMENA WHICH ATTEND THE ELECTRIC DISCHARGE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0408 THE ACTION OF RADIANT HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0409 WITHIN THE EXTREMELY RAREFIED MEDIA THUS PRODUCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0410 HAS YIELDED A GREAT NUMBER OF REMARKABLE RESULTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0411 SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE FAMILIAR TO THE PUBLIC
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0412 BY THE GIESELER TUBES AND THE RADIOMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0413 ALREADY THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE AFFORDED AN UNEXPECTED INSIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0414 INTO THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THERMAL AND ELECTRIC ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0415 AND THEY OPEN UP A VAST FIELD FOR FUTURE INQUIRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0416 INTO SOME OF THE DEEPEST PROBLEMS OF PHYSICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0417 OTHER IMPORTANT STEPS IN THE SAME DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0418 HAVE BEEN EFFECTED BY INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ABSORPTION OF RADIANT HEAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0419 PROCEEDING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES BY SOLID FLUID AND GASEOUS BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0420 AND IT IS A CURIOUS EXAMPLE OF THE INTERCONNECTION OF THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0421 THAT SOME OF THE RESULTS THUS OBTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0422 HAVE PROVED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN METEOROLOGY THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0423 EXISTENCE OF NUMEROUS DARK LINES CONSTANT IN THEIR NUMBER AND POSITION IN THE VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0424 WAS MADE OUT BY FRAUNHOFER IN THE EARLY PART OF THE PRESENT CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0425 BUT MORE THAN FORTY YEARS ELAPSED BEFORE THEIR CAUSES WERE ASCERTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0426 AND THEIR IMPORTANCE RECOGNISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0427 SPECTROSCOPY WHICH THEN TOOK ITS RISE IS PROBABLY THAT EMPLOYMENT OF PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0428 ALREADY WON AS A MEANS OF FURTHER ACQUISITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0429 WHICH MOST IMPRESSES THE IMAGINATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0430 FOR IT HAS SUDDENLY AND IMMENSELY ENLARGED OUR POWER OF OVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0431 WHICH ALMOST INFINITE MINUTENESS ON THE ONE HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0432 AND ALMOST INFINITE DISTANCE ON THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0433 HAVE HITHERTO OPPOSED TO THE RECOGNITION OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0434 THE PRESENCE AND THE CONDITION OF MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0435 ONE EIGHTEEN MILLIONTH OF A GRAIN OF SODIUM IN THE FLAME OF A SPIRIT LAMP
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0436 MAY BE DETECTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME IT GIVES TRUST WORTHY INDICATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0437 OF THE MATERIAL CONSTITUTION NOT ONLY OF THE SUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0438 BUT OF THE FARTHEST OF THOSE FIXED STARS AND NEBULAE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0439 WHICH AFFORD SUFFICIENT LIGHT TO AFFECT THE EYE OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0440 THE PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE OF THE INQUIRER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0441 THE MATHEMATICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ELUCIDATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTRICITY AND THE STUDY OF THE RELATIONS OF THIS FORM OF ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0442 WITH CHEMICAL AND THERMAL ACTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0443 HAD MADE EXTENSIVE PROGRESS BEFORE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0444 BUT THE DETERMINATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF MAGNETISM ON LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0445 THE DISCOVERY OF DIAMAGNETISM OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0446 THE INFLUENCE OF CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE ON MAGNETISM AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0447 THE COMPLETION OF THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF ELECTRICITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0448 ALL BELONG TO THE PRESENT EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0449 TO IT ALSO APPERTAIN THE PRACTICAL EXECUTION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0450 THE WORKING OUT OF THE RESULTS OF THE GREAT INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0451 OBSERVATIONS ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM SUGGESTED BY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0452 HUMBOLDT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0453 AND THE INVENTION OF INSTRUMENTS OF INFINITE DELICACY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0454 AND PRECISION FOR THE QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0455 THE VOLTAIC BATTERY HAS RECEIVED VAST IMPROVEMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0456 WHILE THE INVENTION OF MAGNETO ELECTRIC ENGINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0457 AND OF IMPROVED MEANS OF PRODUCING ORDINARY ELECTRICITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0458 HAS PROVIDED SOURCES OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0459 VASTLY SUPERIOR TO ANY BEFORE EXTANT IN POWER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0460 AND FAR MORE CONVENIENT FOR USE IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0461 IS PERHAPS THIS BRANCH OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE WHICH MAY CLAIM THE PALM FOR ITS PRACTICAL FRUITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0462 NO LESS THAN FOR THE AID WHICH IT HAS FURNISHED TO THE INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0463 OF OTHER PARTS OF THE FIELD OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0464 THE IDEA OF THE PRACTICABILITY OF ESTABLISHING A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DISTANT POINTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0465 BY MEANS OF ELECTRICITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0466 COULD HARDLY FAIL TO HAVE SIMMERED IN THE MINDS OF INGENIOUS MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0467 SINCE WELL NIGH A CENTURY AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0468 EXPERIMENTAL PROOF WAS GIVEN THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0469 ELECTRIC DISTURBANCES COULD BE PROPAGATED THROUGH A WIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0470 TWELVE THOUSAND FEET LONG VARIOUS METHODS OF CARRYING THE SUGGESTION INTO PRACTICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0471 HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WITH SOME DEGREE OF SUCCESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0472 BUT THE SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHY WHICH AT THE PRESENT TIME BRINGS ALL PARTS OF THE CIVILISED WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0473 WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0474 ORIGINATED ONLY ABOUT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE EPOCH UNDER CONSIDERATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0475 IN ITS INFLUENCE ON THE COURSE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0476 THIS INVENTION TAKES ITS PLACE BESIDE THAT OF GUNPOWDER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0477 WHICH TENDED TO ABOLISH THE PHYSICAL INEQUALITIES OF FIGHTING MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0478 OF PRINTING WHICH TENDED TO DESTROY THE EFFECT OF INEQUALITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0479 IN WEALTH AMONG LEARNING MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0480 OF STEAM TRANSPORT WHICH HAS DONE THE LIKE FOR TRAVELLING MEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0481 ALL THESE GIFTS OF SCIENCE ARE AIDS IN THE PROCESS OF LEVELLING UP
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0482 OF REMOVING THE IGNORANT AND BANEFUL PREJUDICES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0483 OF NATION AGAINST NATION PROVINCE AGAINST PROVINCE AND CLASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0484 AGAINST CLASS OF ASSURING THAT SOCIAL ORDER
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0485 WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF PROGRESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0486 WHICH HAS REDEEMED EUROPE FROM BARBARISM AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0487 AGAINST WHICH ONE IS GLAD TO THINK THAT THOSE WHO IN OUR TIME ARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0488 EMPLOYING THEMSELVES IN FANNING THE EMBERS OF ANCIENT WRONG
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0489 IN SETTING CLASS AGAINST CLASS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0490 AND IN TRYING TO TEAR ASUNDER THE EXISTING BONDS OF UNITY ARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0491 UNDERTAKING A FUTILE STRUGGLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0492 THE TELEPHONE IS ONLY SECOND IN PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0493 INVENTED AS IT WERE ONLY THE OTHER DAY IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0494 HAS ALREADY TAKEN ITS PLACE AS AN APPLIANCE OF DAILY LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0495 SIXTY YEARS AGO THE EXTRACTION OF METALS FROM THEIR SOLUTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0496 BY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT WAS SIMPLY A HIGHLY INTERESTING SCIENTIFIC FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0497 AT THE PRESENT DAY THE GALVANO PLASTIC ART IS A GREAT INDUSTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0498 AND IN COMBINATION WITH PHOTOGRAPHY
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0499 PROMISES TO BE OF ENDLESS SERVICE IN THE ARTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0500 ELECTRIC LIGHTING IS ANOTHER GREAT GIFT OF SCIENCE TO CIVILISATION THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0501 PRACTICAL EFFECTS OF WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0502 LARGELY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS COST
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0503 BUT THOSE WHOSE MEMORIES GO BACK TO THE TINDER BOX PERIOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0504 AND RECOLLECT THE COST OF THE FIRST LUCIFER MATCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0505 WILL NOT DESPAIR OF THE RESULTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0506 OF THE APPLICATION OF SCIENCE AND INGENUITY TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0507 THE CHEAP PRODUCTION OF ANYTHING FOR WHICH THERE IS A LARGE DEMAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0508 END OF SECTION THREE THIS HAS BEEN A LIBRIVOX RECORDING
knotyouraveragejo-20080428-adv-adv0509 ALL LIBRIVOX RECORDINGS ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0001 SECTION FOUR OF THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0002 BY T H HUXLEY THE INFLUENCE OF THE PROGRESS OF ELECTRICAL KNOWLEDGE AND INVENTION UPON THAT OF INVESTIGATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0003 IN OTHER FIELDS OF SCIENCE IS HIGHLY REMARKABLE THE COMBINATION OF ELECTRICAL WITH MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0004 HAS PRODUCED INSTRUMENTS BY WHICH NOT ONLY MAY EXTREMELY SMALL INTERVALS OF TIME BE EXACTLY MEASURED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0005 BUT THE VARYING RAPIDITY OF MOVEMENTS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN SUCH INTERVALS AND APPEAR TO THE ORDINARY SENSE INSTANTANEOUS IS RECORDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0006 THE DURATION OF THE WINKING OF AN EYE IS A PROVERBIAL EXPRESSION FOR AN INSTANTANEOUS ACTION BUT BY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0007 THE HELP OF THE REVOLVING CYLINDER AND THE ELECTRICAL MARKING APPARATUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0008 IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN A GRAPHIC RECORD OF SUCH AN ACTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0009 IN WHICH IF IT ENDURES A SECOND THAT SECOND SHALL BE SUBDIVIDED INTO A HUNDRED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0010 OR A THOUSAND EQUAL PARTS AND THE STATE OF THE ACTION AT EACH HUNDREDTH OR THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND EXHIBITED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0011 IN FACT THESE INSTRUMENTS MAY BE SAID TO BE TIME MICROSCOPES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0012 SUCH APPLIANCES HAVE NOT ONLY EFFECTED A REVOLUTION IN PHYSIOLOGY BY THE POWER OF ANALYSING THE PHENOMENA OF MUSCULAR AND NERVOUS ACTIVITY WHICH THEY HAVE CONFERRED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0013 BUT THEY HAVE FURNISHED NEW METHODS OF MEASURING THE RATE OF MOVEMENT OF PROJECTILES TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0014 THE ARTILLERIST AGAIN THE MICROPHONE WHICH RENDERS THE MINUTEST MOVEMENTS AUDIBLE AND WHICH ENABLES A LISTENER TO HEAR THE FOOTFALL OF A FLY HAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0015 EQUIPPED THE SENSE OF HEARING WITH THE MEANS OF ENTERING ALMOST AS DEEPLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0016 INTO THE PENETRALIA OF NATURE AS DOES THE SENSE OF SIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0017 THAT LIGHT EXERTS A REMARKABLE INFLUENCE IN BRINGING ABOUT CERTAIN CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS AND DECOMPOSITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0018 WAS WELL KNOWN FIFTY YEARS AGO AND VARIOUS MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE PERMANENT PICTURES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0019 BY THE HELP OF THAT KNOWLEDGE HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0020 IT WAS NOT TILL EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE HOWEVER THAT PRACTICAL SUCCESS WAS OBTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0021 BUT THE DAGUERREOTYPES WERE BOTH CUMBROUS AND COSTLY AND PHOTOGRAPHY WOULD NEVER HAVE ATTAINED ITS PRESENT IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0022 HAD NOT THE PROGRESS OF INVENTION SUBSTITUTED PAPER AND GLASS FOR THE SILVERED PLATES THEN IN USE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0023 IT IS NOT MY AFFAIR TO DWELL UPON THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE PRESENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0024 DAY BUT IT IS GERMANE TO MY PURPOSE TO REMARK THAT IT HAS FURNISHED A MOST VALUABLE ACCESSORY TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0025 THE METHODS OF RECORDING MOTIONS AND LAPSE OF TIME ALREADY IN EXISTENCE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0026 THE HANDS OF THE ASTRONOMER AND THE METEOROLOGIST IT HAS YIELDED MEANS OF REGISTERING TERRESTRIAL SOLAR PLANETARY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0027 AND STELLAR PHENOMENA INDEPENDENT OF THE SOURCES OF ERROR ATTENDANT ON ORDINARY OBSERVATION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0028 THE HANDS OF THE PHYSICIST NOT ONLY DOES IT RECORD SPECTROSCOPIC PHENOMENA WITH UNSURPASSABLE EASE AND PRECISION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0029 BUT IT HAS REVEALED THE EXISTENCE OF RAYS HAVING POWERFUL CHEMICAL ENERGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0030 OR BEYOND THE VISIBLE LIMITS OF EITHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WHILE TO THE NATURALIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0031 IT FURNISHES THE MEANS BY WHICH THE FORMS OF MANY HIGHLY COMPLICATED OBJECTS MAY BE REPRESENTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0032 WITHOUT THAT POSSIBILITY OF ERROR WHICH IS INHERENT IN THE WORK OF THE DRAUGHTSMAN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0033 IN FACT IN MANY CASES THE STERN IMPARTIALITY OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS AN OBJECTION TO ITS EMPLOYMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0034 IT MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE IMPORTANT AND THE UNIMPORTANT AND HENCE PHOTOGRAPHS OF DISSECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0035 ARE RARELY SO USEFUL AS THE WORK OF A DRAUGHTSMAN WHO IS AT ONCE ACCURATE AND INTELLIGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0036 THE DETERMINATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF A NEW PLANET NEPTUNE FAR BEYOND THE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN BOUNDS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0037 BY MATHEMATICAL DEDUCTION FROM THE FACTS OF PERTURBATION AND THE IMMEDIATE CONFIRMATION OF THAT DETERMINATION IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0038 BY OBSERVERS WHO TURNED THEIR TELESCOPES INTO THE PART OF THE HEAVENS INDICATED AS ITS PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0039 CONSTITUTE A REMARKABLE TESTIMONY OF NATURE TO THE VALIDITY OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ASTRONOMY OF OUR TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0040 IN ADDITION SO MANY NEW ASTEROIDS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THOSE WHICH WERE ALREADY KNOWN TO CIRCULATE IN THE PLACE WHICH THEORETICALLY SHOULD BE OCCUPIED BY A PLANET
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0041 BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER THAT THEIR NUMBER NOW AMOUNTS TO BETWEEN TWO AND THREE HUNDRED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0042 I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE EXTENSION OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0043 BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF SPECTROSCOPY IT HAS NOT ONLY THROWN WONDERFUL LIGHT UPON THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0044 FIXED STARS AND NEBULAE AND COMETS BUT IT HOLDS OUT A PROSPECT OF OBTAINING DEFINITE EVIDENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0045 AS TO THE NATURE OF OUR SO CALLED ELEMENTARY BODIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0046 THE APPLICATION OF THE GENERALISATIONS OF THERMOTICS TO THE PROBLEM OF THE DURATION OF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0047 AND OF DEDUCTIONS FROM TIDAL PHENOMENA TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE LENGTH OF THE DAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0048 AND OF THE TIME OF REVOLUTION OF THE MOON IN PAST EPOCHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0049 OF THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE COMPETENCY OF THE GREAT SECULAR CHANGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0050 KNOWN UNDER THE GENERAL NAME OF THE PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES TO CAUSE CORRESPONDING MODIFICATIONS IN THE CLIMATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0051 OF THE TWO HEMISPHERES OF OUR GLOBE HAVE BROUGHT ASTRONOMY INTO INTIMATE RELATION WITH GEOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0052 GEOLOGY IN FACT PROVES THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE PAST HISTORY OF THE EARTH THE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS OF THE SAME REGION HAVE BEEN WIDELY DIFFERENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0053 AND SEEKS THE EXPLANATION OF THIS IMPORTANT TRUTH FROM THE SISTER SCIENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0054 THE FACTS THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TERTIARY EPOCH EVERGREEN TREES ABOUNDED WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0055 AND THAT IN THE LONG SUBSEQUENT QUATERNARY EPOCH AN ARCTIC CLIMATE WITH ITS ACCOMPANIMENT OF GIGANTIC GLACIERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0056 OBTAINED IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AS FAR SOUTH AS SWITZERLAND AND CENTRAL FRANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0057 ARE AS WELL ESTABLISHED AS ANY TRUTHS OF SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0058 BUT WHETHER THE EXPLANATION OF THESE EXTREME VARIATIONS IN THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF A GREAT PART OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0059 IS TO BE SOUGHT IN THE CONCOMITANT CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF LAND AND WATER SURFACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0060 OF WHICH GEOLOGY AFFORDS EVIDENCE OR IN ASTRONOMICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS THOSE TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0061 IS A QUESTION WHICH MUST AWAIT ITS ANSWER FROM THE SCIENCE OF THE FUTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0062 TURNING NOW TO THE GREAT STEPS IN THAT PROGRESS WHICH THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES HAVE MADE SINCE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0063 WE ARE MET ON THE THRESHOLD OF OUR EPOCH WITH PERHAPS THE GREATEST OF ALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0064 NAMELY THE PROMULGATION BY SCHWANN IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE OF THE GENERALISATION KNOWN AS THE CELL THEORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0065 THE APPLICATION AND EXTENSION OF WHICH BY A HOST OF SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATORS HAS REVOLUTIONISED MORPHOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0066 DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY THANKS TO THE IMMENSE SERIES OF LABORS THUS INAUGURATED THE FOLLOWING FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0067 ALL LIVING BODIES CONTAIN SUBSTANCES OF CLOSELY SIMILAR PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0068 WHICH CONSTITUTE THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF LIFE KNOWN AS PROTOPLASM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0069 SO FAR AS OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE GOES THIS TAKES ITS ORIGIN ONLY FROM PRE EXISTING PROTOPLASM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0070 ALL COMPLEX LIVING BODIES CONSIST AT ONE PERIOD OF THEIR EXISTENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0071 OF AN AGGREGATE OF MINUTE PORTIONS OF SUCH SUBSTANCE OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE CALLED CELLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0072 EACH CELL HAVING ITS OWN LIFE INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHERS THOUGH INFLUENCED BY THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0073 ALL THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS ARE THE RESULTS OF THE MODE OF MULTIPLICATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0074 GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL METAMORPHOSIS OF THESE CELLS CONSIDERED AS MORPHOLOGICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0075 ALL THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS ASSIMILATION SECRETION EXCRETION MOTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0076 GENERATION ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CELLS CONSIDERED AS PHYSIOLOGICAL UNITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0077 EACH INDIVIDUAL AMONG THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS IS A SYNTHESIS OF MILLIONS OF SUBORDINATE INDIVIDUALITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0078 ITS INDIVIDUALITY THEREFORE IS THAT OF A CIVITAS IN THE ANCIENT SENSE OR THAT OF THE LEVIATHAN OF HOBBES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0079 THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0080 THE INTIMATE STRUCTURE AND THE MODES OF CHANGE IN THE CELLS OF THE TWO ARE FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0081 MOREOVER THE HIGHER FORMS ARE EVOLVED FROM LOWER IN THE COURSE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0082 BY ANALOGOUS PROCESSES OF DIFFERENTIATION COALESCENCE AND REDUCTION IN BOTH THE VEGETABLE AND THE ANIMAL WORLDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0083 AT THE PRESENT TIME THE CELL THEORY IN CONSEQUENCE OF RECENT INVESTIGATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0084 INTO THE STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHOSIS OF THE NUCLEUS IS UNDERGOING A NEW DEVELOPMENT OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0085 WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS FORESHADOWS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0086 OF A PHYSICAL THEORY OF HEREDITY ON A SAFER FOUNDATION THAN THOSE WHICH BUFFON AND DARWIN HAVE DEVISED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0087 THE POPULAR BELIEF IN ABIOGENESIS OR THE SO CALLED SPONTANEOUS GENERATION OF THE LOWER FORMS OF LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0088 WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY ALL THE PHILOSOPHERS OF ANTIQUITY HELD ITS GROUND DOWN TO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0089 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FREQUENT CITATION OF THE PHRASE WRONGFULLY ATTRIBUTED TO HARVEY OMNE VIVUM EX OVO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0090 THAT GREAT PHYSIOLOGIST BELIEVED IN SPONTANEOUS GENERATION AS FIRMLY AS ARISTOTLE DID
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0091 AND IT WAS ONLY IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THAT REDI
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0092 BY SIMPLE AND WELL DEVISED EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0093 IN A GREAT NUMBER OF CASES OF SUPPOSED SPONTANEOUS GENERATION THE ANIMALS WHICH MADE THEIR APPEARANCE OWED THEIR ORIGIN TO THE ORDINARY PROCESS OF REPRODUCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0094 AND THUS SHOOK THE ANCIENT DOCTRINE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0095 THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS REVIVED IN A NEW FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0096 BY NEEDHAM AND BUFFON BUT THE EXPERIMENTS OF SPALLANZANI ENFORCED THE CONCLUSIONS OF REDI
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0097 AND COMPELLED THE ADVOCATES OF THE OCCURRENCE OF SPONTANEOUS GENERATION TO SEEK EVIDENCE FOR THEIR HYPOTHESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0098 ONLY AMONG THE PARASITES AND THE LOWEST AND MINUTEST ORGANISMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0099 IT IS JUST FIFTY YEARS SINCE SCHWANN AND OTHERS PROVED THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0100 EVEN WITH RESPECT TO THEM THE SUPPOSED EVIDENCE OF ABIOGENESIS WAS UNTRUSTWORTHY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0101 DURING THE PRESENT EPOCH THE QUESTION WHETHER LIVING MATTER CAN BE PRODUCED IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN BY THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0102 OF OTHER LIVING MATTER HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AFRESH WITH GREAT VIGOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0103 AND THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED BY EXPERIMENTAL METHODS OF A PRECISION AND REFINEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0104 UNKNOWN TO PREVIOUS INVESTIGATORS THE RESULT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF ABIOGENESIS HAS UTTERLY BROKEN DOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0105 IN EVERY CASE WHICH HAS BEEN PROPERLY TESTED SO FAR AS THE LOWEST AND MINUTEST ORGANISMS ARE CONCERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0106 IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THEY NEVER MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE IF THOSE PRECAUTIONS BY WHICH THEIR GERMS ARE CERTAINLY EXCLUDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0107 ARE TAKEN AND IN REGARD TO PARASITES EVERY CASE WHICH SEEMED TO MAKE FOR THEIR GENERATION FROM THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ANIMAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0108 OR PLANT WHICH THEY INFEST HAS BEEN PROVED TO HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0109 WHETHER NOT LIVING MATTER MAY PASS OR EVER HAS UNDER ANY CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0110 PASSED INTO LIVING MATTER WITHOUT THE AGENCY OF PRE EXISTING LIVING MATTER NECESSARILY REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0111 ALL THAT CAN BE SAID IS THAT IT DOES NOT UNDERGO THIS METAMORPHOSIS UNDER ANY KNOWN CONDITIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0112 THOSE WHO TAKE A MONISTIC VIEW OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD MAY FAIRLY HOLD ABIOGENESIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0113 AS A PIOUS OPINION SUPPORTED BY ANALOGY AND DEFENDED BY OUR IGNORANCE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0114 AS MATTERS STAND IT IS EQUALLY JUSTIFIABLE TO REGARD THE PHYSICAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0115 AS A SORT OF DUAL MONARCHY THE KINGDOMS OF LIVING MATTER AND OF NOT LIVING MATTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0116 ARE UNDER ONE SYSTEM OF LAWS AND THERE IS A PERFECT FREEDOM OF EXCHANGE AND TRANSIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0117 BUT NO CLAIM TO BIOLOGICAL NATIONALITY IS VALID EXCEPT BIRTH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY AND DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0118 A HOST OF ACCURATE AND PATIENT INQUIRERS AIDED BY NOVEL METHODS OF PREPARATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0119 WHICH ENABLE THE ANATOMIST TO EXHAUST THE DETAILS OF VISIBLE STRUCTURE AND TO REPRODUCE THEM WITH GEOMETRICAL PRECISION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0120 HAVE INVESTIGATED EVERY IMPORTANT GROUP OF LIVING ANIMALS AND PLANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0121 NO LESS THAN THE FOSSIL RELICS OF FORMER FAUNAE AND FLORAE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0122 AN ENORMOUS ADDITION HAS THUS BEEN MADE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE ESPECIALLY OF THE LOWER FORMS OF LIFE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0123 IT MAY BE SAID THAT MORPHOLOGY HOWEVER INEXHAUSTIBLE IN DETAIL IS COMPLETE IN ITS BROAD FEATURES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0124 CLASSIFICATION WHICH IS MERELY A CONVENIENT SUMMARY EXPRESSION OF MORPHOLOGICAL FACTS HAS UNDERGONE A CORRESPONDING IMPROVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0125 THE BREAKS WHICH FORMERLY SEPARATED OUR GROUPS FROM ONE ANOTHER AS ANIMALS FROM PLANTS VERTEBRATES FROM INVERTEBRATES CRYPTOGAMS FROM PHANEROGAMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0126 HAVE EITHER BEEN FILLED UP OR SHOWN TO HAVE NO THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0127 THE QUESTION OF THE POSITION OF MAN AS AN ANIMAL HAS GIVEN RISE TO MUCH DISPUTATION WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0128 THE RESULT OF PROVING THAT THERE IS NO ANATOMICAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL CHARACTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0129 BY WHICH HE IS MORE WIDELY DISTINGUISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0130 FROM THE GROUP OF ANIMALS MOST NEARLY ALLIED TO HIM THAN THEY ARE FROM ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0131 IN FACT IN THIS PARTICULAR THE CLASSIFICATION OF LINNAEUS HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACTS THAN THOSE OF MOST OF HIS SUCCESSORS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0132 THE STUDY OF MAN AS A GENUS AND SPECIES OF THE ANIMAL WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0133 CONDUCTED WITH REFERENCE TO NO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAN THOSE WHICH WOULD BE ADMITTED BY THE INVESTIGATOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0134 OF ANY OTHER FORM OF ANIMAL LIFE HAS GIVEN RISE TO A SPECIAL BRANCH OF BIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0135 KNOWN AS ANTHROPOLOGY WHICH HAS GROWN WITH GREAT RAPIDITY NUMEROUS SOCIETIES DEVOTED TO THIS PORTION OF SCIENCE HAVE SPRUNG UP
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0136 AND THE ENERGY OF ITS DEVOTEES HAS PRODUCED A COPIOUS LITERATURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0137 THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF THE VARIOUS RACES OF MEN HAVE BEEN STUDIED WITH A MINUTENESS AND ACCURACY HERETOFORE UNKNOWN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0138 DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF HUMAN CONTEMPORARIES OF THE EXTINCT ANIMALS OF THE LATEST GEOLOGICAL EPOCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0139 HAS BEEN OBTAINED PHYSICAL SCIENCE HAS THUS BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE CLOSEST RELATION WITH HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0140 AND WITH ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE STRIKING INVESTIGATIONS WHICH DURING OUR TIME HAVE PUT BEYOND DOUBT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0141 THE VAST ANTIQUITY OF BABYLONIAN AND EGYPTIAN CIVILISATION ARE IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH THE CONCLUSIONS OF ANTHROPOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0142 AS TO THE ANTIQUITY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES CLASSIFICATION IS A LOGICAL PROCESS WHICH CONSISTS IN PUTTING TOGETHER THOSE THINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0143 WHICH ARE LIKE AND KEEPING ASUNDER THOSE WHICH ARE UNLIKE AND A MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF COURSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0144 TAKES NOTES ONLY OF MORPHOLOGICAL LIKENESS AND UNLIKENESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0145 SO LONG THEREFORE AS OUR MORPHOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE WAS ALMOST WHOLLY CONFINED TO ANATOMY THE CHARACTERS OF GROUPS WERE SOLELY ANATOMICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0146 BUT AS THE PHENOMENA OF EMBRYOLOGY WERE EXPLORED THE LIKENESS AND UNLIKENESS OF INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT HAD TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0147 AND AT PRESENT THE STUDY OF ANCESTRAL EVOLUTION INTRODUCES A NEW ELEMENT OF LIKENESS AND UNLIKENESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0148 WHICH IS NOT ONLY EMINENTLY DESERVING OF RECOGNITION BUT MUST ULTIMATELY PREDOMINATE OVER ALL OTHERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0149 A CLASSIFICATION WHICH SHALL REPRESENT THE PROCESS OF ANCESTRAL EVOLUTION IS IN FACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0150 THE END WHICH THE LABORS OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TAXONOMIST MUST KEEP IN VIEW
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0151 BUT IT IS AN END WHICH CANNOT BE ATTAINED UNTIL THE PROGRESS OF PALAEONTOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0152 HAS GIVEN US FAR MORE INSIGHT THAN WE YET POSSESS INTO THE HISTORICAL FACTS OF THE CASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0153 MUCH OF THE SPECULATIVE PHYLOGENY WHICH ABOUNDS AMONG MY PRESENT CONTEMPORARIES REMINDS ME VERY FORCIBLY OF THE SPECULATIVE MORPHOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0154 UNCHECKED BY A KNOWLEDGE OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS RIFE IN MY YOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0155 AS HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTING INQUIRY IN THIS OR THAT DIRECTION IT IS OFTEN EXTREMELY USEFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0156 BUT WHEN THE PRODUCT OF SUCH SPECULATION IS PLACED ON A LEVEL WITH THOSE GENERALISATIONS OF MORPHOLOGICAL TRUTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0157 WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY THE DEFINITIONS OF NATURAL GROUPS IT TENDS TO CONFUSE FANCY WITH FACT AND TO CREATE MERE CONFUSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0158 WE ARE IN DANGER OF DRIFTING INTO A NEW NATUR PHILOSOPHIE WORSE THAN THE OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0159 BECAUSE THERE IS LESS EXCUSE FOR IT BOYLE DID GREAT SERVICE TO SCIENCE BY HIS SCEPTICAL CHEMIST
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0160 AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT AT THE PRESENT DAY A SCEPTICAL BIOLOGIST MIGHT EXERT AN EQUALLY BENEFICENT INFLUENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0161 WHOSO WISHES TO GAIN A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THE PROGRESS OF PHYSIOLOGY SINCE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0162 WILL DO WELL TO COMPARE MUELLER'S PHYSIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0163 WHICH APPEARED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE AND DRAPIEZ EDITION OF RICHARD'S NOUVEAUX ELEMENTS DE BOTANIQUE PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0164 WITH ANY OF THE PRESENT HANDBOOKS OF ANIMALS AND VEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY MUELLER'S WORK WAS A MASTERPIECE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0165 UNSURPASSED SINCE THE TIME OF HALLER AND RICHARD'S BOOK ENJOYED A GREAT REPUTATION AT THE TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0166 BUT THEIR SUCCESSORS TRANSPORT ONE INTO A NEW WORLD THAT WHICH CHARACTERISES THE NEW PHYSIOLOGY IS THAT IT IS PERMEATED BY AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0167 INDEED BASED UPON CONCEPTIONS WHICH THOUGH NOT WHOLLY ABSENT ARE BUT DAWNING ON THE MINDS OF THE OLDER WRITERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0168 MODERN PHYSIOLOGY SETS FORTH AS ITS CHIEF ENDS FIRSTLY THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE FACTS AND CONDITIONS OF CELL LIFE IN GENERAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0169 SECONDLY IN COMPOSITE ORGANISMS THE ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONS OF ORGANS INTO THOSE OF THE CELLS OF WHICH THEY ARE COMPOSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0170 THIRDLY THE EXPLICATION OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH THIS LOCAL CELL LIFE IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0171 CONTROLLED AND BROUGHT INTO RELATION WITH THE LIFE OF THE REST OF THE CELLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0172 WHICH COMPOSE THE ORGANISM FOURTHLY THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF LIFE IN GENERAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0173 ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE LIVING BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0174 ARE OF THE SAME ORDER AS THOSE WHICH TAKE PLACE OUT OF IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0175 AND THAT WHATEVER ENERGY IS EXERTED IN PRODUCING SUCH PHENOMENA
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0176 IS DERIVED FROM THE COMMON STOCK OF ENERGY IN THE UNIVERSE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0177 THE FIFTH PLACE MODERN PHYSIOLOGY INVESTIGATES THE RELATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHICAL PHENOMENA ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0178 THE ASSUMPTION THAT MOLECULAR CHANGES IN DEFINITE PORTIONS OF NERVOUS MATTER STAND IN THE RELATION OF NECESSARY ANTECEDENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0179 TO DEFINITE MENTAL STATES AND OPERATIONS THE WORK WHICH HAS BEEN DONE IN EACH OF THE DIRECTIONS HERE INDICATED IS VAST AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0180 THE ACCUMULATION OF SOLID KNOWLEDGE WHICH HAS BEEN EFFECTED IS CORRESPONDINGLY GREAT FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0181 THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE PHYSIOLOGISTS ARE NOW IN THE POSITION TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE ARRIVED AT CLEAR AND DISTINCT THOUGH BY NO MEANS COMPLETE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0182 CONCEPTIONS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GREAT FUNCTIONS OF ASSIMILATION RESPIRATION SECRETION DISTRIBUTION OF NUTRIMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0183 REMOVAL OF WASTE PRODUCTS MOTION SENSATION AND REPRODUCTION ARE PERFORMED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0184 WHILE THE OPERATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AS A REGULATIVE APPARATUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0185 WHICH INFLUENCES THE ORIGINATION AND THE TRANSMISSION OF MANIFESTATIONS OF ACTIVITY EITHER WITHIN ITSELF OR IN OTHER ORGANS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0186 HAS BEEN LARGELY ELUCIDATED I HAVE POINTED OUT IN AN EARLIER PART OF THIS CHAPTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0187 THAT THE HISTORY OF ALL BRANCHES OF SCIENCE PROVES THAT THEY MUST ATTAIN A CONSIDERABLE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0188 BEFORE THEY YIELD PRACTICAL FRUITS AND THIS IS EMINENTLY TRUE OF PHYSIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0189 IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE PRESENT EPOCH THAT PHYSIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0190 HAVE REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH THEY COULD OFFER A SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION TO AGRICULTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0191 AND IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE PRESENT EPOCH THAT ZOOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0192 HAVE YIELDED ANY VERY GREAT AID TO PATHOLOGY AND HYGIENE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0193 WITHIN THAT TIME THEY HAVE ALREADY RENDERED HIGHLY IMPORTANT SERVICES BY THE EXPLORATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF PARASITISM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0194 NOT ONLY HAVE THE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL PARASITES SUCH AS THE TAPEWORMS AND THE TRICHINA
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0195 WHICH INFEST MEN AND ANIMALS WITH DEADLY RESULTS BEEN CLEARED UP BY MEANS OF EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0196 AND EFFICIENT MODES OF PREVENTION DEDUCED FROM THE DATA SO OBTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0197 BUT THE TERRIBLE AGENCY OF THE PARASITIC FUNGI AND OF THE INFINITESIMALLY MINUTE MICROBES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0198 WHICH WORK FAR GREATER HAVOC AMONG PLANTS AND ANIMALS HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0199 THE PARTICULATE OR GERM THEORY OF DISEASE AS IT IS CALLED LONG SINCE SUGGESTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0200 HAS OBTAINED A FIRM FOUNDATION IN SO FAR AS IT HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE TRUE IN RESPECT OF SUNDRY EPIDEMIC DISORDERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0201 MOREOVER IT HAS THEORETICALLY JUSTIFIED PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES SUCH AS VACCINATION WHICH FORMERLY RESTED ON A MERELY EMPIRICAL BASIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0202 AND IT HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO OTHER DISEASES WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0203 FURTHER JUST AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSE OF SCABIES PROVED THE ABSURDITY OF MANY OF THE OLD PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0204 AND TREATMENT OF THAT DISEASE SO THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAUSE OF SPLENIC FEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0205 AND OTHER SUCH MALADIES HAS GIVEN A NEW DIRECTION TO PROPHYLACTIC AND CURATIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE WORST SCOURGES OF HUMANITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0206 UNLESS THE FANATICISM OF PHILOZOIC SENTIMENT OVERPOWERS THE VOICE OF PHILANTHROPY AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0207 THE LOVE OF DOGS AND CATS SUPERSEDES THAT OF ONE'S NEIGHBOR THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0208 PROGRESS OF EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY WILL INDUBITABLY IN COURSE OF TIME PLACE MEDICINE AND HYGIENE UPON A RATIONAL BASIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0209 TWO CENTURIES AGO ENGLAND WAS DEVASTATED BY THE PLAGUE CLEANLINESS AND COMMON SENSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0210 WERE ENOUGH TO FREE US FROM ITS RAVAGES ONE CENTURY SINCE SMALL POX WAS ALMOST AS GREAT A SCOURGE SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0211 THOUGH WORKING EMPIRICALLY AND ALMOST IN THE DARK HAS REDUCED THAT EVIL TO RELATIVE INSIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0212 AT THE PRESENT TIME SCIENCE WORKING IN THE LIGHT OF CLEAR KNOWLEDGE HAS ATTACKED SPLENIC FEVER AND HAS BEATEN IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0213 IT IS ATTACKING HYDROPHOBIA WITH NO MEAN PROMISE OF SUCCESS SOONER OR LATER IT WILL DEAL IN THE SAME WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0214 WITH DIPHTHERIA TYPHOID AND SCARLET FEVER TO ONE WHO HAS SEEN HALF A STREET SWEPT CLEAR OF ITS CHILDREN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0215 OR HAS LOST HIS OWN BY THESE HORRIBLE PESTILENCES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0216 PASSING ONE'S OFFSPRING THROUGH THE FIRE TO MOLOCH SEEMS HUMANITY COMPARED WITH THE PROPOSAL TO DEPRIVE THEM OF HALF THEIR CHANCES OF HEALTH AND LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0217 BECAUSE OF THE DISCOMFORT TO DOGS AND CATS RABBITS AND FROGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0218 WHICH MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE SEARCH FOR MEANS OF GUARDING THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0219 AN IMMENSE EXTENSION HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0220 AND THE ELUCIDATION OF THE CAUSES WHICH HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT THAT DISTRIBUTION HAS BEEN GREATLY ADVANCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0221 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS BY ALL CIVILISED NATIONS HAS FURNISHED A SOLID FOUNDATION TO CLIMATOLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0222 WHILE A GROWING SENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0223 AFFORDS A WHOLESOME CHECK TO THE TENDENCY TO OVERRATE THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE ON DISTRIBUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0224 EXPEDITIONS SUCH AS THAT OF THE CHALLENGER EQUIPPED NOT FOR GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THROWING LIGHT ON PROBLEMS OF PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0225 HAVE BEEN SENT OUT BY OUR OWN AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND HAVE OBTAINED STORES OF INFORMATION OF THE GREATEST VALUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0226 FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE IN POSSESSION OF SOMETHING LIKE PRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE DEEP SEAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0227 AND OF THE LIVING POPULATION OF THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0228 THE CAREFUL AND EXHAUSTIVE STUDY OF THE PHENOMENA PRESENTED BY THE ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW AND ICE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0229 IN POLAR AND MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE IN OUR TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0230 HAS NOT ONLY REVEALED TO THE GEOLOGIST AN AGENT OF DENUDATION AND TRANSPORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0231 WHICH HAS SLOWLY AND QUIETLY PRODUCED EFFECTS FORMERLY CONFIDENTLY REFERRED TO DILUVIAL CATASTROPHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0232 BUT IT HAS SUGGESTED NEW METHODS OF ACCOUNTING FOR VARIOUS PUZZLING FACTS OF DISTRIBUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0233 PALAEONTOLOGY WHICH TREATS OF THE EXTINCT FORMS OF LIFE AND THEIR SUCCESSION AND DISTRIBUTION UPON OUR GLOBE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0234 A BRANCH OF SCIENCE WHICH COULD HARDLY BE SAID TO EXIST A CENTURY AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0235 HAS UNDERGONE A WONDERFUL DEVELOPMENT IN OUR EPOCH IN SOME GROUPS OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS THE EXTINCT REPRESENTATIVES ALREADY KNOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0236 ARE MORE NUMEROUS AND IMPORTANT THAN THE LIVING THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE EXISTING FAUNA AND FLORA
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0237 IS BUT THE LAST TERM OF A LONG SERIES OF EQUALLY NUMEROUS CONTEMPORARY SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0238 WHICH HAVE SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER BY THE SLOW AND GRADUAL SUBSTITUTION OF SPECIES FOR SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0239 IN THE VAST INTERVAL OF TIME WHICH HAS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE DEPOSITION OF THE EARLIEST FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0240 AND THE PRESENT DAY THERE IS NO REASONABLE GROUND FOR BELIEVING THAT THE OLDEST REMAINS YET OBTAINED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0241 CARRY US EVEN NEAR THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE THE IMPRESSIVE WARNINGS OF LYELL AGAINST HASTY SPECULATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0242 BASED UPON NEGATIVE EVIDENCE HAVE BEEN FULLY JUSTIFIED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0243 TIME AFTER TIME HIGHLY ORGANISED TYPES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN FORMATIONS OF AN AGE IN WHICH THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH FORMS OF LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0244 HAD BEEN CONFIDENTLY DECLARED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THE WESTERN TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES ALONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0245 HAVE YIELDED A WORLD OF EXTINCT ANIMAL FORMS UNDREAMED OF FIFTY YEARS AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0246 AND WHEREVER SUFFICIENTLY NUMEROUS SERIES OF THE REMAINS OF ANY GIVEN GROUP
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0247 WHICH HAS ENDURED FOR A LONG SPACE OF TIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0248 ARE CAREFULLY EXAMINED THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONS ARE NEVER IN DISCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0249 AND OFTEN AFFORD CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF IT AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT CERTAIN FORMS PERSIST WITH VERY LITTLE CHANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0250 FROM THE OLDEST TO THE NEWEST FOSSILIFEROUS FORMATIONS AND THUS SHOW THAT PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT IS A CONTINGENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0251 AND NOT A NECESSARY RESULT OF THE NATURE OF LIVING MATTER GEOLOGY IS AS IT WERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0252 THE BIOLOGY OF OUR PLANET AS A WHOLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0253 IN SO FAR AS IT COMPRISES THE SURFACE CONFIGURATION AND THE INNER STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0254 IT ANSWERS TO MORPHOLOGY IN SO FAR AS IT STUDIES CHANGES OF CONDITION AND THEIR CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0255 IT CORRESPONDS WITH PHYSIOLOGY IN SO FAR AS IT DEALS WITH THE CAUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0256 WHICH HAVE EFFECTED THE PROGRESS OF THE EARTH FROM ITS EARLIEST TO ITS PRESENT STATE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0257 IT FORMS PART OF THE GENERAL DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0258 AN INTERESTING CONTRAST BETWEEN THE GEOLOGY OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THAT OF HALF A CENTURY AGO
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0259 IS PRESENTED BY THE COMPLETE EMANCIPATION OF THE MODERN GEOLOGIST FROM THE CONTROLLING AND PERVERTING INFLUENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0260 OF THEOLOGY ALL POWERFUL AT THE EARLIER DATE AS THE GEOLOGIST OF MY YOUNG DAYS WROTE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0261 HE HAD ONE EYE UPON FACT AND THE OTHER ON GENESIS AT PRESENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0262 HE WISELY KEEPS BOTH EYES ON FACT AND IGNORES THE PENTATEUCHAL MYTHOLOGY ALTOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0263 THE PUBLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY BROUGHT UPON ITS ILLUSTRIOUS AUTHOR A
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0264 PERIOD OF SOCIAL OSTRACISM THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO OUR CHILDREN IS BASED UPON THOSE PRINCIPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0265 WHEWELL HAD THE COURAGE TO ATTACK LYELL'S FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTION WHICH SURELY IS A DICTATE OF COMMON SENSE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0266 THAT WE OUGHT TO EXHAUST KNOWN CAUSES BEFORE SEEKING FOR THE EXPLANATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0267 OF GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA IN CAUSES OF WHICH WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0268 BUT GEOLOGY HAS ADVANCED TO ITS PRESENT STATE BY WORKING FROM LYELL'S AXIOM
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0269 PERHAPS I OUGHT RATHER TO SAY BUTTON'S AXIOM FOR THAT GREAT NATURALIST AND WRITER EMBODIED THE PRINCIPLES OF SOUND GEOLOGY IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0270 A PITHY PHRASE OF THE AND TO THIS DAY THE RECORD OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0271 AFFORDS NO PROOF THAT THE INTENSITY OR THE RAPIDITY OF THE CAUSES OF CHANGE HAS EVER VARIED
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0272 BETWEEN WIDER LIMITS THAN THOSE BETWEEN WHICH THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE YOUNGEST GEOLOGICAL EPOCHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0273 AN INCALCULABLE BENEFIT HAS ACCRUED TO GEOLOGICAL SCIENCE FROM THE ACCURATE AND DETAILED SURVEYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0274 WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN EXECUTED BY SKILLED GEOLOGISTS EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF ALL PARTS OF THE CIVILISED WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0275 IN GEOLOGY THE STUDY OF LARGE MAPS IS AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS SAID TO BE IN POLITICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0276 AND SECTIONS ON A TRUE SCALE ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0277 IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE APPREHENSION OF THE EXTRAORDINARY INSIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0278 OF GEOLOGICAL PERTURBATIONS IN RELATION TO THE WHOLE MASS OF OUR PLANET
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0279 IT SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN THAT WHAT WE CALL CATASTROPHES ARE IN RELATION TO THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0280 CHANGES THE EQUIVALENTS OF WHICH WOULD BE WELL REPRESENTED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW PIMPLES OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0281 THE SCRATCH OF A PIN ON A MAN'S HEAD VAST REGIONS OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE REMAIN GEOLOGICALLY UNKNOWN BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0282 THE AREA ALREADY FAIRLY EXPLORED IS MANY TIMES GREATER THAN IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0283 AND IN MANY PARTS OF EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES THE STRUCTURE OF THE SUPERFICIAL CRUST OF THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0284 HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED WITH GREAT MINUTENESS THE PARALLEL BETWEEN BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGY WHICH I HAVE DRAWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0285 IS FURTHER ILLUSTRATED BY THE MODERN GROWTH OF THAT BRANCH OF THE SCIENCE KNOWN AS PETROLOGY
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0286 WHICH ANSWERS TO HISTOLOGY AND HAS MADE THE MICROSCOPE AS ESSENTIAL AN INSTRUMENT TO THE GEOLOGICAL AS TO THE BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080502-adv-adv0287 THE EVIDENCE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CAUSES NOW IN OPERATION HAS BEEN WONDERFULLY ENLARGED

knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0004 THE FORESTS THE CONIFEROUS FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE THE GRANDEST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL IN THE WORLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0005 AND GROW IN A DELIGHTFUL CLIMATE ON THE MOST INTERESTING AND ACCESSIBLE OF MOUNTAIN RANGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0006 YET STRANGE TO SAY THEY ARE NOT WELL KNOWN MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AGO DAVID DOUGLAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0007 AN ENTHUSIASTIC BOTANIST AND TREE LOVER WANDERED ALONE THROUGH FINE SECTIONS OF THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0008 AND SILVER FIR WOODS WILD WITH DELIGHT A FEW YEARS LATER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0009 OTHER BOTANISTS MADE SHORT JOURNEYS FROM THE COAST INTO THE LOWER WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0010 THEN CAME THE WONDERFUL MULTITUDE OF MINERS INTO THE FOOT HILL ZONE MOSTLY BLIND WITH GOLD DUST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0011 SOON FOLLOWED BY SHEEPMEN WHO WITH WOOL OVER THEIR EYES CHASED THEIR FLOCKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0012 THROUGH ALL THE FOREST BELTS FROM ONE END OF THE RANGE TO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0013 THEN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED AND THOUSANDS OF ADMIRING TOURISTS PASSED THROUGH SECTIONS OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE ZONES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0014 ON THEIR WAY TO THAT WONDERFUL PARK AND GAINED FINE GLIMPSES OF THE SUGAR PINES AND SILVER FIRS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0015 ALONG THE EDGES OF DUSTY TRAILS AND ROADS BUT FEW INDEED STRONG AND FREE WITH EYES UNDIMMED WITH CARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0016 HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH WITH THE TREES TO GAIN ANYTHING LIKE A LOVING CONCEPTION OF THEIR GRANDEUR AND SIGNIFICANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0017 AS MANIFESTED IN THE HARMONIES OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND VARYING ASPECTS THROUGHOUT THE SEASONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0018 AS THEY STAND ARRAYED IN THEIR WINTER GARB REJOICING IN STORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0019 PUTTING FORTH THEIR FRESH LEAVES IN THE SPRING WHILE STEAMING WITH RESINY FRAGRANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0020 RECEIVING THE THUNDER SHOWERS OF SUMMER OR REPOSING HEAVY LADEN WITH RIPE CONES IN THE RICH SUNGOLD OF AUTUMN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0021 FOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS KIND ONE MUST DWELL WITH THE TREES AND GROW WITH THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0022 WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO TIME IN THE ALMANAC SENSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GENERAL FOREST IN BELTS IS READILY PERCEIVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0023 THESE AS WE HAVE SEEN EXTEND IN REGULAR ORDER FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF THE RANGE TO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0024 AND HOWEVER DENSE AND SOMBER THEY MAY APPEAR IN GENERAL VIEWS NEITHER ON THE ROCKY HEIGHTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0025 NOR DOWN IN THE LEAFIEST HOLLOWS WILL YOU FIND ANYTHING TO REMIND YOU OF THE DANK MALARIAL SELVAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0026 OF THE AMAZON AND ORINOCO WITH THEIR BOUNDLESS CONTIGUITY OF SHADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0027 THE MONOTONOUS UNIFORMITY OF THE DEODAR FORESTS OF THE HIMALAYA THE BLACK FOREST OF EUROPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0028 OR THE DENSE DARK WOODS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE WHERE ROLLS THE OREGON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0029 THE GIANT PINES AND FIRS AND SEQUOIAS HOLD THEIR ARMS OPEN TO THE SUNLIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0030 RISING ABOVE ONE ANOTHER ON THE MOUNTAIN BENCHES MARSHALED IN GLORIOUS ARRAY GIVING FORTH THE UTMOST EXPRESSION OF GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0031 WITH INEXHAUSTIBLE VARIETY AND HARMONY THE INVITING OPENNESS OF THE SIERRA WOODS IS ONE OF THEIR MOST DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0032 THE TREES OF ALL THE SPECIES STAND MORE OR LESS APART IN GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0033 OR IN SMALL IRREGULAR GROUPS ENABLING ONE TO FIND A WAY NEARLY EVERYWHERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0034 ALONG SUNNY COLONNADES AND THROUGH OPENINGS THAT HAVE A SMOOTH PARK LIKE SURFACE STREWN WITH BROWN NEEDLES AND BURS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0035 NOW YOU CROSS A WILD GARDEN NOW A MEADOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0036 NOW A FERNY WILLOWY STREAM AND EVER AND ANON YOU EMERGE FROM ALL THE GROVES AND FLOWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0037 UPON SOME GRANITE PAVEMENT OR HIGH BARE RIDGE COMMANDING SUPERB VIEWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0038 ABOVE THE WAVING SEA OF EVERGREENS FAR AND NEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0039 ONE WOULD EXPERIENCE BUT LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN RIDING ON HORSEBACK THROUGH THE SUCCESSIVE BELTS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STORM BEATEN FRINGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0040 OF THE ICY PEAKS THE DEEP CANONS HOWEVER THAT EXTEND FROM THE AXIS OF THE RANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0041 CUT THE BELTS MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY INTO SECTIONS AND PREVENT THE MOUNTED TRAVELER FROM TRACING THEM LENGTHWISE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0042 THIS SIMPLE ARRANGEMENT IN ZONES AND SECTIONS BRINGS THE FOREST AS A WHOLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0043 WITHIN THE COMPREHENSION OF EVERY OBSERVER THE DIFFERENT SPECIES ARE EVER FOUND OCCUPYING THE SAME RELATIVE POSITIONS TO ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0044 AS CONTROLLED BY SOIL CLIMATE AND THE COMPARATIVE VIGOR OF EACH SPECIES IN TAKING AND HOLDING THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0045 AND SO APPRECIABLE ARE THESE RELATIONS ONE NEED NEVER BE AT A LOSS IN DETERMINING WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0046 THE ELEVATION ABOVE SEA LEVEL BY THE TREES ALONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0047 FOR NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF THE SPECIES RANGE UPWARD FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET AND ALL PASS ONE ANOTHER MORE OR LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0048 YET EVEN THOSE POSSESSING THE GREATEST VERTICAL RANGE ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS CONNECTION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0049 AS MUCH AS THEY TAKE ON NEW FORMS CORRESPONDING WITH THE VARIATIONS IN ALTITUDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0050 CROSSING THE TREELESS PLAINS OF THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN FROM THE WEST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0051 AND REACHING THE SIERRA FOOT HILLS YOU ENTER THE LOWER FRINGE OF THE FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0052 COMPOSED OF SMALL OAKS AND PINES GROWING SO FAR APART
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0053 THAT NOT ONE TWENTIETH OF THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND IS IN SHADE AT CLEAR NOONDAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0054 AFTER ADVANCING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES AND MAKING AN ASCENT OF FROM TWO TO THREE THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0055 YOU REACH THE LOWER MARGIN OF THE MAIN PINE BELT COMPOSED OF THE GIGANTIC SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0056 YELLOW PINE INCENSE CEDAR AND SEQUOIA NEXT YOU COME TO THE MAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0057 AND LASTLY TO THE UPPER PINE BELT WHICH SWEEPS UP THE ROCKY ACCLIVITIES OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0058 IN A DWARFED WAVERING FRINGE TO A HEIGHT OF FROM TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0059 THIS GENERAL ORDER OF DISTRIBUTION WITH REFERENCE TO CLIMATE DEPENDENT ON ELEVATION IS PERCEIVED AT ONCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0060 BUT THERE ARE OTHER HARMONIES AS FAR REACHING IN THIS CONNECTION THAT BECOME MANIFEST ONLY AFTER PATIENT OBSERVATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0061 AND STUDY PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0062 IN LONG CURVING BANDS BRAIDED TOGETHER INTO LACE LIKE PATTERNS AND OUTSPREAD IN CHARMING VARIETY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0063 THE KEY TO THIS BEAUTIFUL HARMONY IS THE ANCIENT GLACIERS WHERE THEY FLOWED THE TREES FOLLOWED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0064 TRACING THEIR WAVERING COURSES ALONG CANONS OVER RIDGES AND OVER HIGH ROLLING PLATEAUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0065 THE CEDARS OF LEBANON SAYS HOOKER ARE GROWING UPON ONE OF THE MORAINES OF AN ANCIENT GLACIER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0066 ALL THE FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE GROWING UPON MORAINES BUT MORAINES VANISH LIKE THE GLACIERS THAT MAKE THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0067 EVERY STORM THAT FALLS UPON THEM WASTES THEM CUTTING GAPS DISINTEGRATING BOULDERS AND CARRYING AWAY THEIR DECAYING MATERIAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0068 INTO NEW FORMATIONS UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZABLE BY ANY SAVE STUDENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0069 WHO TRACE THEIR TRANSITIONAL FORMS DOWN FROM THE FRESH MORAINES STILL IN PROCESS OF FORMATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0070 THROUGH THOSE THAT ARE MORE AND MORE ANCIENT AND MORE AND MORE OBSCURED BY VEGETATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0071 AND ALL KINDS OF POST GLACIAL WEATHERING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0072 HAD THE ICE SHEET THAT ONCE COVERED ALL THE RANGE BEEN MELTED SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE FOOT HILLS TO THE SUMMITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0073 THE FLANKS WOULD OF COURSE HAVE BEEN LEFT ALMOST BARE OF SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0074 AND THESE NOBLE FORESTS WOULD BE WANTING MANY GROVES AND THICKETS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE GROWN UP ON LAKE AND AVALANCHE BEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0075 AND MANY A FAIR FLOWER AND SHRUB WOULD HAVE FOUND FOOD AND A DWELLING PLACE IN WEATHERED NOOKS AND CREVICES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0076 BUT THE SIERRA AS A WHOLE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BARE ROCKY DESERT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0077 IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT THE SIERRA FORESTS IN GENERAL INDICATE THE EXTENT AND POSITIONS OF THE ANCIENT MORAINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0078 AS WELL AS THEY DO LINES OF CLIMATE FOR FORESTS PROPERLY SPEAKING CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0079 AND SINCE THE MORAINES HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED UPON THE SOLID ROCK AND ONLY UPON ELECTED PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0080 LEAVING A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE OLD GLACIAL SURFACE BARE WE FIND LUXURIANT FORESTS OF PINE AND FIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0081 ABRUPTLY TERMINATED BY SCORED AND POLISHED PAVEMENTS ON WHICH NOT EVEN A MOSS IS GROWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0082 THOUGH SOIL ALONE IS REQUIRED TO FIT THEM FOR THE GROWTH OF TREES TWO HUNDRED FEET IN HEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0083 THE NUT PINE PINUS SABINIANA THE NUT PINE THE FIRST CONIFER MET IN ASCENDING THE RANGE FROM THE WEST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0084 GROWS ONLY ON THE TORRID FOOTHILLS SEEMING TO DELIGHT IN THE MOST ARDENT SUN HEAT LIKE A PALM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0085 SPRINGING UP HERE AND THERE SINGLY OR IN SCATTERED GROUPS OF FIVE OR SIX
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0086 AMONG SCRUBBY WHITE OAKS AND THICKETS OF CEANOTHUS AND MANZANITA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0087 ITS EXTREME UPPER LIMIT BEING ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA ITS LOWER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0088 ABOUT FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED FEET THIS TREE IS REMARKABLE FOR ITS AIRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0089 WIDESPREAD TROPICAL APPEARANCE WHICH SUGGESTS A REGION OF PALMS RATHER THAN COOL RESINY PINE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0090 NO ONE WOULD TAKE IT AT FIRST SIGHT TO BE A CONIFER OF ANY KIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0091 IT IS SO LOOSE IN HABIT AND SO WIDELY BRANCHED AND ITS FOLIAGE IS SO THIN AND GRAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0092 FULL GROWN SPECIMENS ARE FROM FORTY TO FIFTY FEET IN HEIGHT AND FROM TWO TO THREE FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0093 THE TRUNK USUALLY DIVIDES INTO THREE OR FOUR MAIN BRANCHES ABOUT FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FEET FROM THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0094 WHICH AFTER BEARING AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER SHOOT STRAIGHT UP AND FORM SEPARATE SUMMITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0095 WHILE THE CROOKED SUBORDINATE BRANCHES ASPIRE AND RADIATE AND DROOP IN ORNAMENTAL SPRAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0096 THE SLENDER GRAYISH GREEN NEEDLES ARE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE INCHES LONG LOOSELY TASSELED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0097 AND INCLINED TO DROOP IN HANDSOME CURVES CONTRASTING WITH THE STIFF DARK COLORED TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0098 AND BRANCHES IN A VERY STRIKING MANNER NO OTHER TREE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE SO SUBSTANTIAL IN BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0099 IS IN ITS FOLIAGE SO THIN AND SO PERVIOUS TO THE LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0100 THE SUNBEAMS SIFT THROUGH EVEN THE LEAFIEST TREES WITH SCARCELY ANY INTERRUPTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0101 AND THE WEARY HEATED TRAVELER FINDS BUT LITTLE PROTECTION IN THEIR SHADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0102 THE GENEROUS CROP OF NUTRITIOUS NUTS WHICH THE NUT PINE YIELDS MAKES IT A FAVORITE WITH INDIANS BEARS AND SQUIRRELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0103 THE CONES ARE MOST BEAUTIFUL MEASURING FROM FIVE TO EIGHT INCHES IN LENGTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0104 AND NOT MUCH LESS IN THICKNESS RICH CHOCOLATE BROWN IN COLOR AND PROTECTED BY STRONG DOWN CURVING HOOKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0105 WHICH TERMINATE THE SCALES NEVERTHELESS THE LITTLE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAN OPEN THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0106 INDIANS GATHERING THE RIPE NUTS MAKE A STRIKING PICTURE THE MEN CLIMB THE TREES LIKE BEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0107 AND BEAT OFF THE CONES WITH STICKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0108 OR RECKLESSLY CUT OFF THE MORE FRUITFUL BRANCHES WITH HATCHETS WHILE THE SQUAWS GATHER THE BIG GENEROUS CONES AND ROAST THEM UNTIL THE SCALES OPEN SUFFICIENTLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0109 TO ALLOW THE HARD SHELLED SEEDS TO BE BEATEN OUT THEN IN THE COOL EVENINGS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0110 THEIR CAPACITY FOR DIRT GREATLY INCREASED BY THE SOFT RESIN WITH WHICH THEY ARE ALL BEDRAGGLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0111 FORM CIRCLES AROUND CAMP FIRES ON THE BANK OF THE NEAREST STREAM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0112 AND LIE IN EASY INDEPENDENCE CRACKING NUTS AND LAUGHING AND CHATTERING AS HEEDLESS OF THE FUTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0113 AS THE SQUIRRELS PINUS TUBERCULATA THIS CURIOUS LITTLE PINE IS FOUND AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0114 GROWING IN CLOSE WILLOWY GROVES IT IS EXCEEDINGLY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL IN HABIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0115 ALTHOUGH TREES THAT CHANCE TO STAND ALONE OUTSIDE THE GROVES SWEEP FORTH LONG CURVED BRANCHES PRODUCING A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE ORDINARY GROVE FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0116 THE FOLIAGE IS OF THE SAME PECULIAR GRAY GREEN COLOR AS THAT OF THE NUT PINE AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0117 IS WORN ABOUT AS LOOSELY SO THAT THE BODY OF THE TREE IS SCARCELY OBSCURED BY IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0118 AT THE AGE OF SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS IT BEGINS TO BEAR CONES NOT ON BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0119 BUT ON THE MAIN AXIS AND AS THEY NEVER FALL OFF THE TRUNK IS SOON PICTURESQUELY DOTTED WITH THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0120 THE BRANCHES ALSO BECOME FRUITFUL AFTER THEY ATTAIN SUFFICIENT SIZE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0121 THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE OLDER TREES IS ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0122 AND TWELVE TO FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER THE CONES ARE ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG EXCEEDINGLY HARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0123 AND COVERED WITH A SORT OF SILICIOUS VARNISH AND GUM RENDERING THEM IMPERVIOUS TO MOISTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0124 EVIDENTLY WITH A VIEW TO THE CAREFUL PRESERVATION OF THE SEEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0125 NO OTHER CONIFER IN THE RANGE IS SO CLOSELY RESTRICTED TO SPECIAL LOCALITIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0126 IT IS USUALLY FOUND APART STANDING DEEP IN CHAPARRAL ON SUNNY HILL AND CANON SIDES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0127 WHERE THERE IS BUT LITTLE DEPTH OF SOIL AND WHERE FOUND AT ALL IT IS QUITE PLENTIFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0128 BUT THE ORDINARY TRAVELER FOLLOWING CARRIAGE ROADS AND TRAILS MAY ASCEND THE RANGE MANY TIMES WITHOUT MEETING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0129 WHILE EXPLORING THE LOWER PORTION OF THE MERCED CANON I FOUND A LONELY MINER SEEKING HIS FORTUNE IN A QUARTZ VEIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0130 ON A WILD MOUNTAIN SIDE PLANTED WITH THIS SINGULAR TREE HE TOLD ME THAT HE CALLED IT THE HICKORY PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0131 BECAUSE OF THE WHITENESS AND TOUGHNESS OF THE WOOD IT IS SO LITTLE KNOWN HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0132 THAT IT CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO HAVE A COMMON NAME
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0133 MOST MOUNTAINEERS REFER TO IT AS THAT QUEER LITTLE PINE TREE COVERED ALL OVER WITH BURS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0134 IN MY STUDIES OF THIS SPECIES I FOUND A VERY INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP OF FACTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0135 WHOSE RELATIONS WILL BE SEEN ALMOST AS SOON AS STATED FIRST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0136 ALL THE TREES IN THE GROVES I EXAMINED HOWEVER UNEQUAL IN SIZE ARE OF THE SAME AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0137 SECOND THOSE GROVES ARE ALL PLANTED ON DRY HILLSIDES COVERED WITH CHAPARRAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0138 AND THEREFORE ARE LIABLE TO BE SWEPT BY FIRE THIRD THERE ARE NO SEEDLINGS OR SAPLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0139 IN OR ABOUT THE LIVING GROVES BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A FINE HOPEFUL CROP SPRINGING UP ON THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0140 ONCE OCCUPIED BY ANY GROVE THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY THE BURNING OF THE CHAPARRAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0141 FOURTH THE CONES NEVER FALL OFF AND NEVER DISCHARGE THEIR SEEDS UNTIL THE TREE OR BRANCH TO WHICH THEY BELONG DIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0142 A FULL DISCUSSION OF THE BEARING OF THESE FACTS UPON ONE ANOTHER WOULD PERHAPS BE OUT OF PLACE HERE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0143 I MAY AT LEAST CALL ATTENTION TO THE ADMIRABLE ADAPTATION OF THE TREE TO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0144 THE FIRE SWEPT REGIONS WHERE ALONE IT IS FOUND AFTER A GROVE HAS BEEN DESTROYED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0145 THE GROUND IS AT ONCE SOWN LAVISHLY WITH ALL THE SEEDS RIPENED DURING ITS WHOLE LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0146 WHICH SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY HELD IN STORE WITH REFERENCE TO SUCH A CALAMITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0147 THEN A YOUNG GROVE IMMEDIATELY SPRINGS UP GIVING BEAUTY FOR ASHES SUGAR PINE PINUS LAMBERTIANA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0148 THIS IS THE NOBLEST PINE YET DISCOVERED SURPASSING ALL OTHERS NOT MERELY IN SIZE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0149 BUT ALSO IN KINGLY BEAUTY AND MAJESTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0150 IT TOWERS SUBLIMELY FROM EVERY RIDGE AND CANON OF THE RANGE AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM THREE TO SEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0151 ATTAINING MOST PERFECT DEVELOPMENT AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0152 FULL GROWN SPECIMENS ARE COMMONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET HIGH AND FROM SIX TO EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER NEAR THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0153 THOUGH SOME GRAND OLD PATRIARCH IS OCCASIONALLY MET THAT HAS ENJOYED FIVE OR SIX CENTURIES OF STORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0154 AND ATTAINED A THICKNESS OF TEN OR EVEN TWELVE FEET LIVING ON UNDECAYED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0155 SWEET AND FRESH IN EVERY FIBER IN SOUTHERN OREGON WHERE IT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY DAVID DOUGLAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0156 ON THE HEAD WATERS OF THE UMPQUA IT ATTAINS STILL GRANDER DIMENSIONS ONE SPECIMEN HAVING BEEN MEASURED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0157 THAT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FEET HIGH AND OVER EIGHTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0158 THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND THE DISCOVERER WAS THE DOUGLAS FOR WHOM THE NOBLE DOUGLAS SPRUCE IS NAMED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0159 AND MANY OTHER PLANTS WHICH WILL KEEP HIS MEMORY SWEET AND FRESH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0160 AS LONG AS TREES AND FLOWERS ARE LOVED HIS FIRST VISIT TO THE PACIFIC COAST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0161 WAS MADE IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE THE OREGON INDIANS WATCHED HIM WITH CURIOSITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0162 AS HE WANDERED IN THE WOODS COLLECTING SPECIMENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0163 AND UNLIKE THE FUR GATHERING STRANGERS THEY HAD HITHERTO KNOWN CARING NOTHING ABOUT TRADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0164 AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO KNOW HIM BETTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0165 AND SAW THAT FROM YEAR TO YEAR THE GROWING THINGS OF THE WOODS AND PRAIRIES WERE HIS ONLY OBJECTS OF PURSUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0166 THEY CALLED HIM THE MAN OF GRASS A TITLE OF WHICH HE WAS PROUD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0167 DURING HIS FIRST SUMMER ON THE WATERS OF THE COLUMBIA HE MADE FORT VANCOUVER HIS HEADQUARTERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0168 MAKING EXCURSIONS FROM THIS HUDSON BAY POST IN EVERY DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0169 ON ONE OF HIS LONG TRIPS HE SAW IN AN INDIAN'S POUCH SOME
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0170 OF THE SEEDS OF A NEW SPECIES OF PINE WHICH HE LEARNED WERE OBTAINED FROM A VERY LARGE TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0171 FAR TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THE COLUMBIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0172 AT THE END OF THE NEXT SUMMER RETURNING TO FORT VANCOUVER AFTER THE SETTING IN OF THE WINTER RAINS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0173 BEARING IN MIND THE BIG PINE HE HAD HEARD OF
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0174 HE SET OUT ON AN EXCURSION UP THE WILLAMETTE VALLEY IN SEARCH OF IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0175 AND HOW HE FARED AND WHAT DANGERS AND HARDSHIPS HE ENDURED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0176 ARE BEST TOLD IN HIS OWN JOURNAL FROM WHICH I QUOTE AS FOLLOWS OCTOBER TWENTY SIX
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0177 EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX WEATHER DULL COLD AND CLOUDY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0178 WHEN MY FRIENDS IN ENGLAND ARE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH MY TRAVELS I FEAR THEY WILL THINK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0179 I HAVE TOLD THEM NOTHING BUT MY MISERIES I QUITTED MY CAMP EARLY IN THE MORNING TO SURVEY THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0180 LEAVING MY GUIDE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE HORSES UNTIL MY RETURN IN THE EVENING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0181 ABOUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM THE CAMP I MET AN INDIAN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0182 WHO ON PERCEIVING ME INSTANTLY STRUNG HIS BOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0183 PLACED ON HIS LEFT ARM A SLEEVE OF RACCOON SKIN AND STOOD ON THE DEFENSIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0184 BEING QUITE SURE THAT CONDUCT WAS PROMPTED BY FEAR AND NOT BY HOSTILE INTENTIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0185 THE POOR FELLOW HAVING PROBABLY NEVER SEEN SUCH A BEING AS MYSELF BEFORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0186 I LAID MY GUN AT MY FEET ON THE GROUND AND WAVED MY HAND FOR HIM TO COME TO ME
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0187 WHICH HE DID SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT CAUTION I THEN MADE HIM PLACE HIS BOW AND QUIVER OF ARROWS BESIDE MY GUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0188 AND STRIKING A LIGHT GAVE HIM A SMOKE OUT OF MY OWN PIPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0189 AND A PRESENT OF A FEW BEADS WITH MY PENCIL I MADE A ROUGH SKETCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0190 OF THE CONE AND PINE TREE WHICH I WANTED TO OBTAIN AND DREW HIS ATTENTION TO IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0191 WHEN HE INSTANTLY POINTED WITH HIS HAND TO THE HILLS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES DISTANT TOWARDS THE SOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0192 AND WHEN I EXPRESSED MY INTENTION OF GOING THITHER CHEERFULLY SET OUT TO ACCOMPANY ME
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0193 AT MIDDAY I REACHED MY LONG WISHED FOR PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0194 AND LOST NO TIME IN EXAMINING THEM AND ENDEAVORING TO COLLECT SPECIMENS AND SEEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0195 NEW AND STRANGE THINGS SELDOM FAIL TO MAKE STRONG IMPRESSIONS AND ARE THEREFORE FREQUENTLY OVER RATED SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0196 THAT LEST I SHOULD NEVER SEE MY FRIENDS IN ENGLAND TO INFORM THEM VERBALLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0197 OF THIS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND IMMENSELY GRAND TREE I SHALL HERE STATE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE LARGEST I COULD FIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0198 AMONG SEVERAL THAT HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN BY THE WIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0199 AT THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE IS FIFTY SEVEN FEET NINE INCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0200 AT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR FEET SEVENTEEN FEET FIVE INCHES THE EXTREME LENGTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0201 TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FEET AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE EITHER TO CLIMB THE TREE OR HEW IT DOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0202 I ENDEAVORED TO KNOCK OFF THE CONES BY FIRING AT THEM WITH BALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0203 WHEN THE REPORT OF MY GUN BROUGHT EIGHT INDIANS ALL OF THEM PAINTED WITH RED EARTH ARMED WITH BOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0204 ARROWS BONE TIPPED SPEARS AND FLINT KNIVES THEY APPEARED ANYTHING BUT FRIENDLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0205 I EXPLAINED TO THEM WHAT I WANTED AND THEY SEEMED SATISFIED AND SAT DOWN TO SMOKE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0206 BUT PRESENTLY I SAW ONE OF THEM STRING HIS BOW AND ANOTHER SHARPEN HIS FLINT KNIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0207 WITH A PAIR OF WOODEN PINCERS AND SUSPEND IT OFF THE WRIST OF HIS RIGHT HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0208 FURTHER TESTIMONY OF THEIR INTENTIONS WAS UNNECESSARY TO SAVE MYSELF BY FLIGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0209 SO WITHOUT HESITATION I STEPPED BACK ABOUT FIVE PACES COCKED MY GUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0210 DREW ONE OF THE PISTOLS OUT OF MY BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0211 AND HOLDING IT IN MY LEFT HAND AND THE GUN IN MY RIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0212 SHOWED MYSELF DETERMINED TO FIGHT FOR MY LIFE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I ENDEAVORED TO PRESERVE MY COOLNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0213 AND THUS WE STOOD LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT MAKING ANY MOVEMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0214 OR UTTERING A WORD FOR PERHAPS TEN MINUTES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0215 WHEN ONE AT LAST WHO SEEMED TO BE THE LEADER GAVE A SIGN THAT THEY WISHED FOR SOME TOBACCO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0216 THIS I SIGNIFIED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE IF THEY FETCHED A QUANTITY OF CONES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0217 THEY WENT OFF IMMEDIATELY IN SEARCH OF THEM AND NO SOONER WERE THEY ALL OUT OF SIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0218 THAN I PICKED UP MY THREE CONES AND SOME TWIGS OF THE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0219 AND MADE THE QUICKEST POSSIBLE RETREAT HURRYING BACK TO THE CAMP WHICH I REACHED BEFORE DUSK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0220 I NOW WRITE LYING ON THE GRASS WITH MY GUN COCKED BESIDE ME AND PENNING THESE LINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0221 BY THE LIGHT OF MY COLUMBIAN CANDLE NAMELY AN IGNITED PIECE OF ROSIN WOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0222 THIS GRAND PINE DISCOVERED UNDER SUCH EXCITING CIRCUMSTANCES DOUGLAS NAMED IN HONOR OF HIS FRIEND DR LAMBERT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0223 OF LONDON THE TRUNK IS A SMOOTH ROUND DELICATELY TAPERED SHAFT MOSTLY WITHOUT LIMBS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0224 AND COLORED RICH PURPLISH BROWN USUALLY ENLIVENED WITH TUFTS OF YELLOW LICHEN AT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0225 THE TOP OF THIS MAGNIFICENT BOLE LONG CURVING BRANCHES SWEEP GRACEFULLY OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0226 SOMETIMES FORMING A PALM LIKE CROWN BUT FAR MORE NOBLY IMPRESSIVE THAN ANY PALM CROWN I EVER BEHELD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0227 THE NEEDLES ARE ABOUT THREE INCHES LONG FINELY TEMPERED AND ARRANGED IN RATHER CLOSE TASSELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0228 AT THE ENDS OF SLENDER BRANCHLETS THAT CLOTHE THE LONG OUTSWEEPING LIMBS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0229 HOW WELL THEY SING IN THE WIND AND HOW STRIKINGLY HARMONIOUS AN EFFECT IS MADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0230 BY THE IMMENSE CYLINDRICAL CONES THAT DEPEND LOOSELY FROM THE ENDS OF THE MAIN BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0231 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT NATURE CAN DO IN THE WAY OF PINE BURS UNTIL HE HAS SEEN THOSE OF THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0232 THEY ARE COMMONLY FROM FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND THREE IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0233 GREEN SHADED WITH DARK PURPLE ON THEIR SUNWARD SIDES THEY ARE RIPE IN SEPTEMBER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0234 AND OCTOBER THEN THE FLAT SCALES OPEN AND THE SEEDS TAKE WING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0235 BUT THE EMPTY CONES BECOME STILL MORE BEAUTIFUL AND EFFECTIVE FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0236 THEIR DIAMETER IS NEARLY DOUBLED BY THE SPREADING OF THE SCALES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0237 AND THEIR COLOR CHANGES TO A WARM YELLOWISH BROWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0238 WHILE THEY REMAIN SWINGING ON THE TREE ALL THE FOLLOWING WINTER AND SUMMER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0239 AND CONTINUE EFFECTIVELY BEAUTIFUL EVEN ON THE GROUND MANY YEARS AFTER THEY FALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0240 THE WOOD IS DELICIOUSLY FRAGRANT AND FINE IN GRAIN AND TEXTURE IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0241 IS OF A RICH CREAM YELLOW AS IF FORMED OF CONDENSED SUNBEAMS RETINOSPORA OBTUSA SIEBOLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0242 THE GLORY OF EASTERN FORESTS IS CALLED FU SI NO KI TREE OF THE SUN BY THE JAPANESE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0243 THE SUGAR PINE IS THE SUN TREE OF THE SIERRA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0244 UNFORTUNATELY IT IS GREATLY PRIZED BY THE LUMBERMEN AND IN ACCESSIBLE PLACES IS ALWAYS THE FIRST TREE IN THE WOODS TO FEEL THEIR STEEL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0245 BUT THE REGULAR LUMBERMEN WITH THEIR SAW MILLS HAVE BEEN LESS GENERALLY DESTRUCTIVE THUS FAR THAN THE SHINGLE MAKERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0246 THE WOOD SPLITS FREELY AND THERE IS A CONSTANT DEMAND FOR THE SHINGLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0247 AND BECAUSE AN AX AND SAW AND FROW ARE ALL THE CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR THE BUSINESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0248 MANY OF THAT DRIFTING UNSTEADY CLASS OF MEN SO LARGE IN CALIFORNIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0249 ENGAGE IN IT FOR A FEW MONTHS IN THE YEAR WHEN PROSPECTORS HUNTERS RANCH HANDS ETC
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0250 TOUCH THEIR BOTTOM DOLLAR AND FIND THEMSELVES OUT OF EMPLOYMENT THEY SAY WELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0251 I CAN AT LEAST GO TO THE SUGAR PINES AND MAKE SHINGLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0252 A FEW POSTS ARE SET IN THE GROUND AND A SINGLE LENGTH CUT FROM THE FIRST TREE FELLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0253 PRODUCES BOARDS ENOUGH FOR THE WALLS AND ROOF OF A CABIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0254 ALL THE REST THE LUMBERMAN MAKES IS FOR SALE AND HE IS SPEEDILY INDEPENDENT NO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0255 GARDENER OR HAYMAKER IS MORE SWEETLY PERFUMED THAN THESE ROUGH MOUNTAINEERS WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS BUSINESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0256 BUT THE HAVOC THEY MAKE IS MOST DEPLORABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0257 THE SUGAR FROM WHICH THE COMMON NAME IS DERIVED IS TO MY TASTE THE BEST OF SWEETS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0258 BETTER THAN MAPLE SUGAR IT EXUDES FROM THE HEART WOOD WHERE WOUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0259 EITHER BY FOREST FIRES OR THE AX IN THE SHAPE OF IRREGULAR CRISP CANDY LIKE KERNELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0260 WHICH ARE CROWDED TOGETHER IN MASSES OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE LIKE CLUSTERS OF RESIN BEADS WHEN FRESH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0261 IT IS PERFECTLY WHITE AND DELICIOUS BUT BECAUSE MOST OF THE WOUNDS ON WHICH IT IS FOUND HAVE BEEN MADE BY FIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0262 THE EXUDING SAP IS STAINED ON THE CHARRED SURFACE AND THE HARDENED SUGAR BECOMES BROWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0263 INDIANS ARE FOND OF IT BUT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS LAXATIVE PROPERTIES ONLY SMALL QUANTITIES MAY BE EATEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0264 BEARS SO FOND OF SWEET THINGS IN GENERAL SEEM NEVER TO TASTE IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0265 AT LEAST I HAVE FAILED TO FIND ANY TRACE OF THEIR TEETH IN THIS CONNECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0266 NO LOVER OF TREES WILL EVER FORGET HIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0267 NOR WILL HE AFTERWARD NEED A POET TO CALL HIM TO LISTEN WHAT THE PINE TREE SAITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0268 IN MOST PINE TREES THERE IS A SAMENESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH TO MOST PEOPLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0269 IS APT TO BECOME MONOTONOUS FOR THE TYPICAL SPIRY FORM HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0270 AFFORDS BUT LITTLE SCOPE FOR APPRECIABLE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER THE SUGAR PINE IS AS FREE FROM CONVENTIONALITIES OF FORM AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0271 MOTION AS ANY OAK NO TWO ARE ALIKE EVEN TO THE MOST INATTENTIVE OBSERVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0272 AND NOTWITHSTANDING THEY ARE EVER TOSSING OUT THEIR IMMENSE ARMS IN WHAT MIGHT SEEM MOST EXTRAVAGANT GESTURES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0273 THERE IS A MAJESTY AND REPOSE ABOUT THEM THAT PRECLUDES ALL POSSIBILITY OF THE GROTESQUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0274 OR EVEN PICTURESQUE IN THEIR GENERAL EXPRESSION THEY ARE THE PRIESTS OF PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0275 AND SEEM EVER TO BE ADDRESSING THE SURROUNDING FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0276 THE YELLOW PINE IS FOUND GROWING WITH THEM ON WARM HILLSIDES AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0277 THE WHITE SILVER FIR ON COOL NORTHERN SLOPES BUT NOBLE AS THESE ARE THE SUGAR PINE IS EASILY KING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0278 AND SPREADS HIS ARMS ABOVE THEM IN BLESSING WHILE THEY ROCK AND WAVE IN SIGN OF RECOGNITION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0279 THE MAIN BRANCHES ARE SOMETIMES FOUND TO BE FORTY FEET IN LENGTH YET PERSISTENTLY SIMPLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0280 SELDOM DIVIDING AT ALL EXCEPTING NEAR THE END
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0281 BUT ANYTHING LIKE A BARE CABLE APPEARANCE IS PREVENTED BY THE SMALL TASSELED BRANCHLETS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0282 THAT EXTEND ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN THESE SUPERB LIMBS SWEEP OUT SYMMETRICALLY ON ALL SIDES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0283 A CROWN SIXTY OR SEVENTY FEET WIDE IS FORMED WHICH GRACEFULLY POISED ON THE SUMMIT OF THE NOBLE SHAFT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0284 AND FILLED WITH SUNSHINE IS ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS FOREST OBJECTS CONCEIVABLE COMMONLY HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0285 THERE IS A GREAT PREPONDERANCE OF LIMBS TOWARD THE EAST AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE PREVAILING WINDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0286 NO OTHER PINE SEEMS TO ME SO UNFAMILIAR AND SELF CONTAINED IN APPROACHING IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0287 WE FEEL AS IF IN THE PRESENCE OF A SUPERIOR BEING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0288 AND BEGIN TO WALK WITH A LIGHT STEP HOLDING OUR BREATH THEN PERCHANCE WHILE WE GAZE AWE STRICKEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0289 ALONG COMES A MERRY SQUIRREL CHATTERING AND LAUGHING TO BREAK THE SPELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0290 RUNNING UP THE TRUNK WITH NO CEREMONY AND GNAWING OFF THE CONES AS IF THEY WERE MADE ONLY FOR HIM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0291 WHILE THE CARPENTER WOODPECKER HAMMERS AWAY AT THE BARK DRILLING HOLES IN WHICH TO STORE HIS WINTER SUPPLY OF ACORNS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0292 ALTHOUGH SO WILD AND UNCONVENTIONAL WHEN FULL GROWN THE SUGAR PINE IS A REMARKABLY PROPER TREE IN YOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0293 THE OLD IS THE MOST ORIGINAL AND INDEPENDENT IN APPEARANCE OF ALL THE SIERRA EVERGREENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0294 THE YOUNG IS THE MOST REGULAR A STRICT FOLLOWER OF CONIFEROUS FASHIONS SLIM ERECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0295 WITH LEAFY SUPPLE BRANCHES KEPT EXACTLY IN PLACE EACH TAPERING IN OUTLINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0296 AND TERMINATING IN A SPIRY POINT THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSITIONAL FORMS PRESENTED BETWEEN THE CAUTIOUS NEATNESS OF YOUTH AND BOLD FREEDOM OF MATURITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0297 OFFER A DELIGHTFUL STUDY AT THE AGE OF FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS THE SHY FASHIONABLE FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0298 BEGINS TO BE BROKEN UP SPECIALIZED BRANCHES PUSH OUT IN THE MOST UNTHOUGHT OF PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0299 AND BEND WITH THE GREAT CONES AT ONCE MARKING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0300 AND THIS BEING CONSTANTLY AUGMENTED FROM YEAR TO YEAR BY THE VARYING ACTION OF THE SUNLIGHT WINDS SNOW STORMS ETC
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0301 THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE TREE IS NEVER AGAIN LOST IN THE GENERAL FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0302 THE MOST CONSTANT COMPANION OF THIS SPECIES IS THE YELLOW PINE AND A WORTHY COMPANION IT IS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0303 THE DOUGLAS SPRUCE LIBOCEDRUS SEQUOIA AND THE WHITE SILVER FIR ARE ALSO MORE OR LESS ASSOCIATED WITH IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0304 BUT ON MANY DEEP SOILED MOUNTAIN SIDES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0305 IT FORMS THE BULK OF THE FOREST FILLING EVERY SWELL AND HOLLOW AND DOWN PLUNGING RAVINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0306 THE MAJESTIC CROWNS APPROACHING EACH OTHER IN BOLD CURVES MAKE A GLORIOUS CANOPY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0307 THROUGH WHICH THE TEMPERED SUNBEAMS POUR SILVERING THE NEEDLES AND GILDING THE MASSIVE BOLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0308 AND FLOWERY PARK LIKE GROUND INTO A SCENE OF ENCHANTMENT ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0309 THE MOST SUNNY SLOPES THE WHITE FLOWERED FRAGRANT CHAMOEBATIA IS SPREAD LIKE A CARPET BRIGHTENED DURING EARLY SUMMER WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0310 THE CRIMSON SARCODES THE WILD ROSE AND INNUMERABLE VIOLETS AND GILIAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0311 NOT EVEN IN THE SHADIEST NOOKS WILL YOU FIND ANY RANK UNTIDY WEEDS OR UNWHOLESOME DARKNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0312 ON THE NORTH SIDES OF RIDGES THE BOLES ARE MORE SLENDER AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0313 THE GROUND IS MOSTLY OCCUPIED BY AN UNDERBRUSH OF HAZEL CEANOTHUS AND FLOWERING DOGWOOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0314 BUT NEVER SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT THE TRAVELER FROM SAUNTERING WHERE HE WILL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0315 WHILE THE CROWNING BRANCHES ARE NEVER IMPENETRABLE TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN AND NEVER SO INTERBLENDED AS TO LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0316 VIEW THE FOREST FROM BENEATH OR FROM SOME COMMANDING RIDGE TOP EACH TREE PRESENTS A STUDY IN ITSELF
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0317 AND PROCLAIMS THE SURPASSING GRANDEUR OF THE SPECIES YELLOW OR SILVER PINE PINUS PONDEROSA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0318 THE SILVER OR YELLOW PINE AS IT IS COMMONLY CALLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0319 RANKS SECOND AMONG THE PINES OF THE SIERRA AS A LUMBER TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0320 AND ALMOST RIVALS THE SUGAR PINE IN STATURE AND NOBLENESS OF PORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0321 BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIOR POWERS OF ENDURING VARIATIONS OF CLIMATE AND SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0322 IT HAS A MORE EXTENSIVE RANGE THAN ANY OTHER CONIFER GROWING ON THE SIERRA ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0323 THE WESTERN SLOPE IT IS FIRST MET AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0324 AND EXTENDS NEARLY TO THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE TIMBER LINE THENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0325 CROSSING THE RANGE BY THE LOWEST PASSES IT DESCENDS TO THE EASTERN BASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0326 AND PUSHES OUT FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE INTO THE HOT VOLCANIC PLAINS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0327 GROWING BRAVELY UPON WELL WATERED MORAINES GRAVELLY LAKE BASINS ARCTIC RIDGES AND TORRID LAVA BEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0328 PLANTING ITSELF UPON THE LIPS OF CRATERS FLOURISHING VIGOROUSLY EVEN THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0329 AND TOSSING RIPE CONES AMONG THE ASHES AND CINDERS OF NATURE'S HEARTHS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0330 THE AVERAGE SIZE OF FULL GROWN TREES ON THE WESTERN SLOPE WHERE IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0331 IS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED FEET IN HEIGHT AND FROM FIVE TO SIX FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0332 THOUGH SPECIMENS MAY EASILY BE FOUND THAT ARE CONSIDERABLY LARGER I MEASURED ONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0333 GROWING AT AN ELEVATION OF FOUR THOUSAND FEET IN THE VALLEY OF THE MERCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0334 THAT IS A FEW INCHES OVER EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET HIGH WHERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0335 THERE IS PLENTY OF FREE SUNSHINE AND OTHER CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0336 IT PRESENTS A STRIKING CONTRAST IN FORM TO THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0337 BEING A SYMMETRICAL SPIRE FORMED OF A STRAIGHT ROUND TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0338 CLAD WITH INNUMERABLE BRANCHES THAT ARE DIVIDED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0339 ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY BRANCHLESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0340 BUT WHERE IT GROWS AT ALL CLOSE THREE FOURTHS OR MORE BECOME NAKED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0341 THE TREE PRESENTING THEN A MORE SLENDER AND ELEGANT SHAFT THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0342 THE BARK IS MOSTLY ARRANGED IN MASSIVE PLATES SOME OF THEM MEASURING FOUR OR FIVE FEET IN LENGTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0343 BY EIGHTEEN INCHES IN WIDTH WITH A THICKNESS OF THREE OR FOUR INCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0344 FORMING A QUITE MARKED AND DISTINGUISHING FEATURE THE NEEDLES ARE OF A FINE WARM YELLOW GREEN COLOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0345 SIX TO EIGHT INCHES LONG FIRM AND ELASTIC AND CROWDED IN HANDSOME RADIANT TASSELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0346 ON THE UPTURNING ENDS OF THE BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR INCHES LONG AND TWO AND A HALF WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0347 GROWING IN CLOSE SESSILE CLUSTERS AMONG THE LEAVES THE SPECIES ATTAINS ITS NOBLEST FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0348 IN FILLED UP LAKE BASINS ESPECIALLY IN THOSE OF THE OLDER YOSEMITES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0349 AND SO PROMINENT A PART DOES IT FORM OF THEIR GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0350 THAT IT MAY WELL BE CALLED THE YOSEMITE PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0351 RIPE SPECIMENS FAVORABLY SITUATED ARE ALMOST ALWAYS TWO HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0352 AND THE BRANCHES CLOTHE THE TRUNK NEARLY TO THE GROUND AS SEEN IN THE ILLUSTRATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0353 THE JEFFREY VARIETY ATTAINS ITS FINEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE RANGE IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0354 THE WIDE BASINS OF THE MCCLOUD AND PITT RIVERS WHERE IT FORMS MAGNIFICENT FORESTS SCARCELY INVADED BY ANY OTHER TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0355 IT DIFFERS FROM THE ORDINARY FORM IN SIZE BEING ONLY ABOUT HALF AS TALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0356 AND IN ITS REDDER AND MORE CLOSELY FURROWED BARK GRAYISH GREEN FOLIAGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0357 LESS DIVIDED BRANCHES AND LARGER CONES BUT INTERMEDIATE FORMS COME IN WHICH MAKE A CLEAR SEPARATION IMPOSSIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0358 ALTHOUGH SOME BOTANISTS REGARD IT AS A DISTINCT SPECIES IT IS THIS VARIETY THAT CLIMBS STORM SWEPT RIDGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0359 AND WANDERS OUT AMONG THE VOLCANOES OF THE GREAT BASIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0360 WHETHER EXPOSED TO EXTREMES OF HEAT OR COLD IT IS DWARFED LIKE EVERY OTHER TREE AND BECOMES ALL KNOTS AND ANGLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0361 WHOLLY UNLIKE THE MAJESTIC FORMS WE HAVE BEEN SKETCHING OLD SPECIMENS BEARING CONES ABOUT AS BIG AS PINEAPPLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0362 MAY SOMETIMES BE FOUND CLINGING TO RIFTED ROCKS AT AN ELEVATION OF SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0363 WHOSE HIGHEST BRANCHES SCARCE REACH ABOVE ONE'S SHOULDERS I HAVE OFTENTIMES FEASTED ON THE BEAUTY OF THESE NOBLE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0364 WHEN THEY WERE TOWERING IN ALL THEIR WINTER GRANDEUR LADEN WITH SNOW ONE MASS OF BLOOM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0365 IN SUMMER TOO WHEN THE BROWN STAMINATE CLUSTERS HANG THICK AMONG THE SHIMMERING NEEDLES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0366 AND THE BIG PURPLE BURS ARE RIPENING IN THE MELLOW LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0367 BUT IT IS DURING CLOUDLESS WIND STORMS THAT THESE COLOSSAL PINES ARE MOST IMPRESSIVELY BEAUTIFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0368 THEN THEY BOW LIKE WILLOWS THEIR LEAVES STREAMING FORWARD ALL IN ONE DIRECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0369 AND WHEN THE SUN SHINES UPON THEM AT THE REQUIRED ANGLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0370 ENTIRE GROVES GLOW AS IF EVERY LEAF WERE BURNISHED SILVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0371 THE FALL OF TROPIC LIGHT ON THE ROYAL CROWN OF A PALM IS A TRULY GLORIOUS SPECTACLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0372 THE FERVID SUN FLOOD BREAKING UPON THE GLOSSY LEAVES IN LONG LANCE RAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0373 LIKE MOUNTAIN WATER AMONG BOULDERS BUT TO ME THERE IS SOMETHING MORE IMPRESSIVE IN THE FALL OF LIGHT UPON THESE SILVER PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0374 IT SEEMS BEATEN TO THE FINEST DUST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0375 AND IS SHED OFF IN MYRIADS OF MINUTE SPARKLES THAT SEEM TO COME FROM THE VERY HEART OF THE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0376 AS IF LIKE RAIN FALLING UPON FERTILE SOIL IT HAD BEEN ABSORBED TO REAPPEAR IN FLOWERS OF LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0377 THIS SPECIES ALSO GIVES FORTH THE FINEST MUSIC TO THE WIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0378 AFTER LISTENING TO IT IN ALL KINDS OF WINDS NIGHT AND DAY SEASON AFTER SEASON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0379 I THINK I COULD APPROXIMATE TO MY POSITION ON THE MOUNTAINS BY THIS PINE MUSIC ALONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0380 IF YOU WOULD CATCH THE TONES OF SEPARATE NEEDLES CLIMB A TREE THEY ARE WELL TEMPERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0381 AND GIVE FORTH NO UNCERTAIN SOUND EACH STANDING OUT WITH NO INTERFERENCE EXCEPTING DURING HEAVY GALES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0382 THEN YOU MAY DETECT THE CLICK OF ONE NEEDLE UPON ANOTHER READILY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THEIR FREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0383 WING LIKE HUM SOME IDEA OF THEIR TEMPER MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE FACT THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0384 NOTWITHSTANDING THEY ARE SO LONG THE VIBRATIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO THE PECULIAR SHIMMERING OF THE LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0385 ARE MADE AT THE RATE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER MINUTE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0386 WHEN A SUGAR PINE AND ONE OF THIS SPECIES EQUAL IN SIZE ARE OBSERVED TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0387 THE LATTER IS SEEN TO BE FAR MORE SIMPLE IN MANNERS MORE LITHELY GRACEFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0388 AND ITS BEAUTY IS OF A KIND MORE EASILY APPRECIATED BUT THEN IT IS ON THE OTHER HAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0389 MUCH LESS DIGNIFIED AND ORIGINAL IN DEMEANOR THE SILVER PINE SEEMS EAGER TO SHOOT ALOFT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0390 EVEN WHILE IT IS DROWSING IN AUTUMN SUN GOLD YOU MAY STILL DETECT A SKYWARD ASPIRATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0391 BUT THE SUGAR PINE SEEMS TOO UNCONSCIOUSLY NOBLE AND TOO COMPLETE IN EVERY WAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0392 TO LEAVE ROOM FOR EVEN A HEAVENWARD CARE DOUGLAS SPRUCE PSEUDOTSUGA DOUGLASII
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0393 THIS TREE IS THE KING OF THE SPRUCES AS THE SUGAR PINE IS KING OF PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0394 IT IS BY FAR THE MOST MAJESTIC SPRUCE I EVER BEHELD IN ANY FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0395 AND ONE OF THE LARGEST AND LONGEST LIVED OF THE GIANTS THAT FLOURISH THROUGHOUT THE MAIN PINE BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0396 OFTEN ATTAINING A HEIGHT OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET AND A DIAMETER OF SIX OR SEVEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0397 WHERE THE GROWTH IS NOT TOO CLOSE THE STRONG SPREADING BRANCHES COME MORE THAN HALFWAY DOWN THE TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0398 AND THESE ARE HUNG WITH INNUMERABLE SLENDER SWAYING SPRAYS THAT ARE HANDSOMELY FEATHERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0399 WITH THE SHORT LEAVES WHICH RADIATE AT RIGHT ANGLES ALL AROUND THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0400 THIS VIGOROUS SPRUCE IS EVER BEAUTIFUL WELCOMING THE MOUNTAIN WINDS AND THE SNOW AS WELL AS THE MELLOW SUMMER LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0401 AND MAINTAINING ITS YOUTHFUL FRESHNESS UNDIMINISHED FROM CENTURY TO CENTURY THROUGH A THOUSAND STORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0402 IT MAKES ITS FINEST APPEARANCE IN THE MONTHS OF JUNE AND JULY THE RICH BROWN BUDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0403 WITH WHICH ITS SPRAYS ARE TIPPED SWELL AND BREAK ABOUT THIS TIME REVEALING THE YOUNG LEAVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0404 WHICH AT FIRST ARE BRIGHT YELLOW MAKING THE TREE APPEAR AS IF COVERED WITH GAY BLOSSOMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0405 WHILE THE PENDULOUS BRACTED CONES WITH THEIR SHELL LIKE SCALES ARE A CONSTANT ADORNMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0406 THE YOUNG TREES ARE MOSTLY GATHERED INTO BEAUTIFUL FAMILY GROUPS EACH SAPLING EXQUISITELY SYMMETRICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0407 THE PRIMARY BRANCHES ARE WHORLED REGULARLY AROUND THE AXIS GENERALLY IN FIVES WHILE EACH IS DRAPED WITH LONG FEATHERY SPRAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0408 THAT DESCEND IN CURVES AS FREE AND AS FINELY DRAWN AS THOSE OF FALLING WATER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0409 IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON IT GROWS IN DENSE FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0410 GROWING TALL AND MAST LIKE TO A HEIGHT OF THREE HUNDRED FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0411 AND IS GREATLY PRIZED AS A LUMBER TREE BUT IN THE SIERRA IT IS SCATTERED AMONG OTHER TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0412 OR FORMS SMALL GROVES SELDOM ASCENDING HIGHER THAN FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0413 AND NEVER MAKING WHAT WOULD BE CALLED A FOREST IT IS NOT PARTICULAR IN ITS CHOICE OF SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0414 WET OR DRY SMOOTH OR ROCKY IT MAKES OUT TO LIVE WELL ON THEM ALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0415 TWO OF THE LARGEST SPECIMENS I HAVE MEASURED ARE IN YOSEMITE VALLEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0416 ONE OF WHICH IS MORE THAN EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0417 AND IS GROWING UPON THE TERMINAL MORAINE OF THE RESIDUAL GLACIER THAT OCCUPIED THE SOUTH FORK CANON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0418 THE OTHER IS NEARLY AS LARGE GROWING UPON ANGULAR BLOCKS OF GRANITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0419 THAT HAVE BEEN SHAKEN FROM THE PRECIPITOUS FRONT OF THE LIBERTY CAP NEAR THE NEVADA FALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0420 NO OTHER TREE SEEMS SO CAPABLE OF ADAPTING ITSELF TO EARTHQUAKE TALUSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0421 AND MANY OF THESE ROUGH BOULDER SLOPES ARE OCCUPIED BY IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0422 ESPECIALLY IN YOSEMITE GORGES MOISTENED BY THE SPRAY OF WATERFALLS INCENSE CEDAR LIBOCEDRUS DECURRENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0423 THE INCENSE CEDAR IS ANOTHER OF THE GIANTS QUITE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0424 WITHOUT EXCLUSIVELY OCCUPYING ANY CONSIDERABLE AREA OR EVEN MAKING EXTENSIVE GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0425 IT ASCENDS TO ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET ON THE WARMER HILLSIDES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0426 AND REACHES THE CLIMATE MOST CONGENIAL TO IT AT ABOUT FROM THREE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0427 GROWING VIGOROUSLY AT THIS ELEVATION ON ALL KINDS OF SOIL AND IN PARTICULAR IT IS CAPABLE OF ENDURING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0428 MORE MOISTURE ABOUT ITS ROOTS THAN ANY OF ITS COMPANIONS EXCEPTING ONLY THE SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0429 THE LARGEST SPECIMENS ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH AND SEVEN FEET IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0430 THE BARK IS BROWN OF A SINGULARLY RICH TONE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO ARTISTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0431 AND THE FOLIAGE IS TINTED WITH A WARMER YELLOW THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER EVERGREEN IN THE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0432 CASTING YOUR EYE OVER THE GENERAL FOREST FROM SOME RIDGE TOP THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0433 COLOR ALONE OF ITS SPIRY SUMMITS IS SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY IT IN ANY COMPANY IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0434 YOUTH SAY UP TO THE AGE OF SEVENTY OR EIGHTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0435 NO OTHER TREE FORMS SO STRICTLY TAPERED A CONE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0436 THE BRANCHES SWOOP OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD IN BOLD CURVES EXCEPTING THE YOUNGER ONES NEAR THE TOP
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0437 WHICH ASPIRE WHILE THE LOWEST DROOP TO THE GROUND AND ALL SPREAD OUT IN FLAT FERNY PLUMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0438 BEAUTIFULLY FRONDED AND IMBRICATED UPON ONE ANOTHER AS IT BECOMES OLDER IT GROWS STRIKINGLY IRREGULAR AND PICTURESQUE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0439 LARGE SPECIAL BRANCHES PUT OUT AT RIGHT ANGLES FROM THE TRUNK FORM BIG STUBBORN ELBOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0440 AND THEN SHOOT UP PARALLEL WITH THE AXIS VERY OLD TREES ARE USUALLY DEAD AT THE TOP
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0441 THE MAIN AXIS PROTRUDING ABOVE AMPLE MASSES OF GREEN PLUMES GRAY AND LICHEN COVERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0442 AND DRILLED FULL OF ACORN HOLES BY THE WOODPECKERS THE PLUMES ARE EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0443 NO WAVING FERN FROND IN SHADY DELL IS MORE UNRESERVEDLY BEAUTIFUL IN FORM AND TEXTURE OR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0444 HALF SO INSPIRING IN COLOR AND SPICY FRAGRANCE IN ITS PRIME THE WHOLE TREE IS THATCHED WITH THEM SO
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0445 THAT THEY SHED OFF RAIN AND SNOW LIKE A ROOF MAKING FINE MANSIONS FOR STORM BOUND BIRDS AND MOUNTAINEERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0446 BUT IF YOU WOULD SEE THE LIBOCEDRUS IN ALL ITS GLORY YOU MUST GO TO THE WOODS IN WINTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0447 THEN IT IS LADEN WITH MYRIADS OF FOUR SIDED STAMINATE CONES ABOUT THE SIZE OF WHEAT GRAINS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0448 WINTER WHEAT PRODUCING A GOLDEN TINGE AND FORMING A NOBLE ILLUSTRATION OF NATURE'S IMMORTAL VIGOR AND VIRILITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0449 THE FERTILE CONES ARE ABOUT THREE FOURTHS OF AN INCH LONG BORNE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PLUMY BRANCHLETS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0450 WHERE THEY SERVE TO ENRICH STILL MORE THE SURPASSING BEAUTY OF THIS GRAND WINTER BLOOMING GOLDENROD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0451 WHITE SILVER FIR ABIES CONCOLOR WE COME NOW TO THE MOST REGULARLY PLANTED OF ALL THE MAIN FOREST BELTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0452 COMPOSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF TWO NOBLE FIRS A CONCOLOR AND A MAGNIFICA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0453 IT EXTENDS WITH NO MARKED INTERRUPTION FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0454 AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM FIVE THOUSAND TO NEARLY NINE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0455 IN ITS YOUTH A CONCOLOR IS A CHARMINGLY SYMMETRICAL TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0456 WITH BRANCHES REGULARLY WHORLED IN LEVEL COLLARS AROUND ITS WHITISH GRAY AXIS WHICH TERMINATES IN A STRONG
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0457 HOPEFUL SHOOT THE LEAVES ARE IN TWO HORIZONTAL ROWS ALONG BRANCHLETS THAT COMMONLY ARE LESS THAN EIGHT YEARS OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0458 FORMING HANDSOME PLUMES PINNATED LIKE THE FRONDS OF FERNS THE CONES ARE GRAYISH GREEN WHEN RIPE CYLINDRICAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0459 ABOUT FROM THREE TO FOUR INCHES LONG BY ONE AND A HALF TO TWO INCHES WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0460 AND STAND UPRIGHT ON THE UPPER BRANCHES FULL GROWN TREES FAVORABLY SITUATED AS TO SOIL AND EXPOSURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0461 ARE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER NEAR THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0462 THOUGH LARGER SPECIMENS ARE BY NO MEANS RARE AS OLD AGE CREEPS ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0463 THE BARK BECOMES ROUGHER AND GRAYER THE BRANCHES LOSE THEIR EXACT REGULARITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0464 MANY ARE SNOW BENT OR BROKEN OFF AND THE MAIN AXIS OFTEN BECOMES DOUBLE OR OTHERWISE IRREGULAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0465 FROM ACCIDENTS TO THE TERMINAL BUD OR SHOOT BUT THROUGHOUT ALL THE VICISSITUDES OF ITS LIFE ON THE MOUNTAINS COME WHAT MAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0466 THE NOBLE GRANDEUR OF THE SPECIES IS PATENT TO EVERY EYE MAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR OR RED FIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0467 ABIES MAGNIFICA THIS IS THE MOST CHARMINGLY SYMMETRICAL OF ALL THE GIANTS OF THE SIERRA WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0468 FAR SURPASSING ITS COMPANION SPECIES IN THIS RESPECT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0469 AND EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM IT BY THE PURPLISH RED BARK WHICH IS ALSO MORE CLOSELY FURROWED THAN THAT OF THE WHITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0470 AND BY ITS LARGER CONES MORE REGULARLY WHORLED AND FRONDED BRANCHES AND BY ITS LEAVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0471 WHICH ARE SHORTER AND GROW ALL AROUND THE BRANCHLETS AND POINT UPWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0472 IN SIZE THESE TWO SILVER FIRS ARE ABOUT EQUAL THE MAGNIFICA PERHAPS A LITTLE THE TALLER
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0473 SPECIMENS FROM TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH ARE NOT RARE ON WELL GROUND MORAINE SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0474 AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0475 THE LARGEST THAT I MEASURED STANDS BACK THREE MILES FROM THE BRINK OF THE NORTH WALL OF YOSEMITE VALLEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0476 FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0477 A DIAMETER OF A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0478 HAPPY THE MAN WITH THE FREEDOM AND THE LOVE TO CLIMB ONE OF THESE SUPERB TREES IN FULL FLOWER AND FRUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0479 HOW ADMIRABLE THE FOREST WORK OF NATURE IS THEN SEEN TO BE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0480 AS ONE MAKES HIS WAY UP THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE BROAD FRONDED BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0481 ALL ARRANGED IN EXQUISITE ORDER AROUND THE TRUNK LIKE THE WHORLED LEAVES OF LILIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0482 AND EACH BRANCH AND BRANCHLET ABOUT AS STRICTLY PINNATE AS THE MOST SYMMETRICAL FERN FROND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0483 THE STAMINATE CONES ARE SEEN GROWING STRAIGHT DOWNWARD FROM THE UNDER SIDE OF THE YOUNG BRANCHES IN LAVISH PROFUSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0484 MAKING FINE PURPLE CLUSTERS AMID THE GRAYISH GREEN FOLIAGE ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0485 THE TOPMOST BRANCHES THE FERTILE CONES ARE SET FIRMLY ON END LIKE SMALL CASKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0486 THEY ARE ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG THREE WIDE COVERED WITH A FINE GRAY DOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0487 AND STREAKED WITH CRYSTAL BALSAM THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN POURED UPON EACH CONE FROM ABOVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0488 BOTH THE SILVER FIRS LIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OR MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0489 WHEN THE CONDITIONS ABOUT THEM ARE AT ALL FAVORABLE SOME VENERABLE PATRIARCH MAY OFTEN BE SEEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0490 HEAVILY STORM MARKED TOWERING IN SEVERE MAJESTY ABOVE THE RISING GENERATION WITH A PROTECTING GROVE OF SAPLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0491 PRESSING CLOSE AROUND HIS FEET EACH DRESSED WITH SUCH LOVING CARE THAT NOT A LEAF SEEMS WANTING
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0492 OTHER COMPANIES ARE MADE UP OF TREES NEAR THE PRIME OF LIFE EXQUISITELY HARMONIZED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0493 TO ONE ANOTHER IN FORM AND GESTURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0494 AS IF NATURE HAD CULLED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH NICE DISCRIMINATION FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0495 IT IS FROM THIS TREE CALLED RED FIR BY THE LUMBERMAN THAT MOUNTAINEERS ALWAYS CUT BOUGHS TO SLEEP ON WHEN THEY ARE SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE WITHIN ITS LIMITS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0496 TWO ROWS OF THE PLUSHY BRANCHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0497 OVERLAPPING ALONG THE MIDDLE AND A CRESCENT OF SMALLER PLUMES MIXED WITH FERNS AND FLOWERS FOR A PILLOW FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0498 THE VERY BEST BED IMAGINABLE THE ESSENCES OF THE PRESSED LEAVES SEEM TO FILL EVERY PORE OF ONE'S BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0499 THE SOUNDS OF FALLING WATER MAKE A SOOTHING HUSH WHILE THE SPACES BETWEEN THE GRAND SPIRES AFFORD NOBLE OPENINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0500 THROUGH WHICH TO GAZE DREAMILY INTO THE STARRY SKY EVEN IN THE MATTER OF SENSUOUS EASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0501 ANY COMBINATION OF CLOTH STEEL SPRINGS AND FEATHERS SEEMS VULGAR IN COMPARISON
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0502 THE FIR WOODS ARE DELIGHTFUL SAUNTERING GROUNDS AT ANY TIME OF YEAR BUT MOST SO IN AUTUMN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0503 THEN THE NOBLE TREES ARE HUSHED IN THE HAZY LIGHT AND DRIP WITH BALSAM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0504 THE CONES ARE RIPE AND THE SEEDS WITH THEIR AMPLE PURPLE WINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0505 MOTTLE THE AIR LIKE FLOCKS OF BUTTERFLIES WHILE DEER FEEDING IN THE FLOWERY OPENINGS BETWEEN THE GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0506 AND BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS IN THE BRANCHES MAKE A PLEASANT STIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0507 WHICH ENRICHES THE DEEP BROODING CALM OF THE WILDERNESS AND GIVES A PECULIAR IMPRESSIVENESS TO EVERY TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0508 NO WONDER THE ENTHUSIASTIC DOUGLAS WENT WILD WITH JOY WHEN HE FIRST DISCOVERED THIS SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0509 EVEN IN THE SIERRA WHERE SO MANY NOBLE EVERGREENS CHALLENGE ADMIRATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0510 WE LINGER AMONG THESE COLOSSAL FIRS WITH FRESH LOVE AND EXTOL THEIR BEAUTY AGAIN AND AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0511 AS IF NO OTHER IN THE WORLD COULD HENCEFORTH CLAIM OUR REGARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0512 IT IS IN THESE WOODS THE GREAT GRANITE DOMES RISE THAT ARE SO STRIKING AND CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURE OF THE SIERRA AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0513 HERE TOO WE FIND THE BEST OF THE GARDEN MEADOWS THEY LIE LEVEL ON THE TOPS OF THE DIVIDING RIDGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0514 OR SLOPING ON THE SIDES OF THEM EMBEDDED IN THE MAGNIFICENT FOREST SOME OF THESE MEADOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0515 ARE IN GREAT PART OCCUPIED BY VERATRUMALBA WHICH HERE GROWS RANK AND TALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0516 WITH BOAT SHAPED LEAVES THIRTEEN INCHES LONG AND TWELVE INCHES WIDE RIBBED LIKE THOSE OF CYPRIPEDIUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0517 COLUMBINE GROWS ON THE DRIER MARGINS WITH TALL LARKSPURS AND LUPINES WAIST DEEP IN GRASSES AND SEDGES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0518 SEVERAL SPECIES OF CASTILLEIA ALSO MAKE A BRIGHT SHOW IN BEDS OF BLUE AND WHITE VIOLETS AND DAISIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0519 BUT THE GLORY OF THESE FOREST MEADOWS IS A LILY L PARVUM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0520 THE FLOWERS ARE ORANGE COLORED AND QUITE SMALL THE SMALLEST I EVER SAW OF THE TRUE LILIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0521 BUT IT IS SHOWY NEVERTHELESS FOR IT IS SEVEN TO EIGHT FEET HIGH AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0522 WAVES MAGNIFICENT RACEMES OF TEN TO TWENTY FLOWERS OR MORE OVER ONE'S HEAD
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0523 WHILE IT STANDS OUT IN THE OPEN GROUND WITH JUST ENOUGH OF GRASS AND OTHER PLANTS ABOUT IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0524 TO MAKE A FRINGE FOR ITS FEET AND SHOW IT OFF TO BEST ADVANTAGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0525 A DRY SPOT A LITTLE WAY BACK FROM THE MARGIN OF A SILVER FIR LILY GARDEN MAKES A GLORIOUS CAMPGROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0526 ESPECIALLY WHERE THE SLOPE IS TOWARD THE EAST AND OPENS A VIEW OF THE DISTANT PEAKS ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE RANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0527 THE TALL LILIES ARE BROUGHT FORWARD IN ALL THEIR GLORY BY THE LIGHT OF YOUR BLAZING CAMP FIRE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0528 RELIEVED AGAINST THE OUTER DARKNESS AND THE NEAREST OF THE TREES WITH THEIR WHORLED BRANCHES TOWER ABOVE YOU LIKE LARGER LILIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0529 AND THE SKY SEEN THROUGH THE GARDEN OPENING SEEMS ONE VAST MEADOW OF WHITE LILY STARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0530 IN THE MORNING EVERYTHING IS JOYOUS AND BRIGHT THE DELICIOUS PURPLE OF THE DAWN CHANGES SOFTLY TO DAFFODIL YELLOW AND WHITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0531 WHILE THE SUNBEAMS POURING THROUGH THE PASSES BETWEEN THE PEAKS GIVE A MARGIN OF GOLD TO EACH OF THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0532 THEN THE SPIRES OF THE FIRS IN THE HOLLOWS OF THE MIDDLE REGION CATCH THE GLOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0533 AND YOUR CAMP GROVE IS FILLED WITH LIGHT THE BIRDS BEGIN TO STIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0534 SEEKING SUNNY BRANCHES ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW FOR SUN BATHS AFTER THE COLD NIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0535 AND LOOKING FOR THEIR BREAKFASTS EVERY ONE OF THEM AS FRESH AS A LILY AND AS CHARMINGLY ARRAYED
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0536 INNUMERABLE INSECTS BEGIN TO DANCE THE DEER WITHDRAW FROM THE OPEN GLADES AND RIDGE TOPS TO THEIR LEAFY HIDING PLACES IN THE CHAPARRAL
knotyouraveragejo-20080524-mtn-mtn0537 THE FLOWERS OPEN AND STRAIGHTEN THEIR PETALS AS THE DEW VANISHES EVERY PULSE BEATS HIGH

knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0005 THE KING OF ALL THE CONIFERS IN THE WORLD THE NOBLEST OF A NOBLE RACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0006 IT EXTENDS IN A WIDELY INTERRUPTED BELT FROM A SMALL GROVE ON THE MIDDLE FORK OF THE AMERICAN RIVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0007 TO THE HEAD OF DEER CREEK A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0008 THE NORTHERN LIMIT BEING NEAR THE THIRTY NINTH PARALLEL THE SOUTHERN A LITTLE BELOW THE THIRTY SIXTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0009 AND THE ELEVATION OF THE BELT ABOVE THE SEA VARIES FROM ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0010 FROM THE AMERICAN RIVER GROVE TO THE FOREST ON KING'S RIVER THE SPECIES OCCURS ONLY IN SMALL ISOLATED GROUPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0011 SO SPARSELY DISTRIBUTED ALONG THE BELT THAT THREE OF THE GAPS IN IT ARE FROM FORTY TO SIXTY MILES WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0012 BUT FROM KING'S RIVER SOUTHWARD THE SEQUOIA IS NOT RESTRICTED TO MERE GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0013 BUT EXTENDS ACROSS THE BROAD RUGGED BASINS OF THE KAWEAH AND TULE RIVERS IN NOBLE FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0014 A DISTANCE OF NEARLY SEVENTY MILES THE CONTINUITY OF THIS PART OF THE BELT BEING BROKEN ONLY BY DEEP CANONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0015 THE FRESNO THE LARGEST OF THE NORTHERN GROVES OCCUPIES AN AREA OF THREE OR FOUR SQUARE MILES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0016 A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THE FAMOUS MARIPOSA GROVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0017 ALONG THE BEVELED RIM OF THE CANON OF THE SOUTH FORK OF KING'S RIVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0018 THERE IS A MAJESTIC FOREST OF SEQUOIA ABOUT SIX MILES LONG BY TWO WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0019 THIS IS THE NORTHERNMOST ASSEMBLAGE OF BIG TREES THAT MAY FAIRLY BE CALLED A FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0020 DESCENDING THE PRECIPITOUS DIVIDE BETWEEN THE KING'S RIVER AND KAWEAH YOU ENTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0021 THE GRAND FORESTS THAT FORM THE MAIN CONTINUOUS PORTION OF THE BELT ADVANCING SOUTHWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0022 THE GIANTS BECOME MORE AND MORE IRREPRESSIBLY EXUBERANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0023 HEAVING THEIR MASSIVE CROWNS INTO THE SKY FROM EVERY RIDGE AND SLOPE AND WAVING ONWARD IN GRACEFUL COMPLIANCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0024 WITH THE COMPLICATED TOPOGRAPHY OF THE REGION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0025 THE FINEST OF THE KAWEAH SECTION OF THE BELT IS ON THE BROAD RIDGE BETWEEN MARBLE CREEK AND THE MIDDLE FORK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0026 AND EXTENDS FROM THE GRANITE HEADLANDS OVERLOOKING THE HOT PLAINS TO WITHIN A FEW MILES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0027 OF THE COOL GLACIAL FOUNTAINS OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0028 THE EXTREME UPPER LIMIT OF THE BELT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AND SOUTH FORKS OF THE KAWEAH AT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0029 AN ELEVATION OF EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED FEET BUT THE FINEST BLOCK OF BIG TREE FOREST IN THE ENTIRE BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0030 IS ON THE NORTH FORK OF TULE RIVER IN THE NORTHERN GROVES THERE ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW YOUNG TREES OR SAPLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0031 BUT HERE FOR EVERY OLD STORM STRICKEN GIANT THERE ARE MANY IN ALL THE GLORY OF PRIME VIGOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0032 AND FOR EACH OF THESE A CROWD OF EAGER HOPEFUL YOUNG TREES AND SAPLINGS GROWING HEARTILY ON MORAINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0033 ROCKY LEDGES ALONG WATERCOURSES AND IN THE MOIST ALLUVIUM OF MEADOWS SEEMINGLY IN HOT PURSUIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0034 OF ETERNAL LIFE BUT THOUGH THE AREA OCCUPIED BY THE SPECIES INCREASES SO MUCH FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0035 THERE IS NO MARKED INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0036 A HEIGHT OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0037 AND A DIAMETER NEAR THE GROUND OF ABOUT TWENTY FEET IS PERHAPS ABOUT THE AVERAGE SIZE OF FULL GROWN TREES FAVORABLY SITUATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0038 SPECIMENS TWENTY FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER ARE NOT VERY RARE AND A FEW ARE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0039 THE CALAVERAS GROVE THERE ARE FOUR TREES OVER THREE HUNDRED FEET IN HEIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0040 THE TALLEST OF WHICH BY CAREFUL MEASUREMENT IS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0041 THE LARGEST I HAVE YET MET IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0042 IS A MAJESTIC OLD SCARRED MONUMENT IN THE KING'S RIVER FOREST
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0043 IT IS THIRTY FIVE FEET EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER INSIDE THE BARK FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0044 UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS THESE GIANTS PROBABLY LIVE FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE THOUGH FEW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0045 OF EVEN THE LARGER TREES ARE MORE THAN HALF AS OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0046 I NEVER SAW A BIG TREE THAT HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0047 BARRING ACCIDENTS THEY SEEM TO BE IMMORTAL BEING EXEMPT FROM ALL THE DISEASES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0048 THAT AFFLICT AND KILL OTHER TREES UNLESS DESTROYED BY MAN THEY LIVE ON INDEFINITELY UNTIL BURNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0049 SMASHED BY LIGHTNING OR CAST DOWN BY STORMS OR BY THE GIVING WAY OF THE GROUND ON WHICH THEY STAND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0050 THE AGE OF ONE THAT WAS FELLED IN THE CALAVERAS GROVE FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING ITS STUMP FOR A DANCING FLOOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0051 WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AND ITS DIAMETER MEASURED ACROSS THE STUMP TWENTY FOUR FEET INSIDE THE BARK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0052 ANOTHER THAT WAS CUT DOWN IN THE KING'S RIVER FOREST WAS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0053 BUT NEARLY A THOUSAND YEARS OLDER TWENTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS THOUGH NOT A VERY OLD LOOKING TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0054 IT WAS FELLED TO PROCURE A SECTION FOR EXHIBITION AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0055 THUS AN OPPORTUNITY WAS GIVEN TO COUNT ITS ANNUAL RINGS OF GROWTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0056 THE COLOSSAL SCARRED MONUMENT IN THE KING'S RIVER FOREST MENTIONED ABOVE IS BURNED HALF THROUGH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0057 AND I SPENT A DAY IN MAKING AN ESTIMATE OF ITS AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0058 CLEARING AWAY THE CHARRED SURFACE WITH AN AX AND CAREFULLY COUNTING THE ANNUAL RINGS WITH THE AID OF A POCKET LENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0059 THE WOOD RINGS IN THE SECTION I LAID BARE WERE SO INVOLVED AND CONTORTED IN SOME PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0060 THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE ITS AGE EXACTLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0061 BUT I COUNTED OVER FOUR THOUSAND RINGS WHICH SHOWED THAT THIS TREE WAS IN ITS PRIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0062 SWAYING IN THE SIERRA WINDS WHEN CHRIST WALKED THE EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0063 NO OTHER TREE IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS I KNOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0064 HAS LOOKED DOWN ON SO MANY CENTURIES AS THE SEQUOIA OR OPENS SUCH IMPRESSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE VIEWS INTO HISTORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0065 SO EXQUISITELY HARMONIOUS AND FINELY BALANCED ARE EVEN THE VERY MIGHTIEST OF THESE MONARCHS OF THE WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0066 IN ALL THEIR PROPORTIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THERE NEVER IS ANYTHING OVERGROWN OR MONSTROUS LOOKING ABOUT THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0067 ON COMING IN SIGHT OF THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE LIKELY TO SAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0068 OH SEE WHAT BEAUTIFUL NOBLE LOOKING TREES ARE TOWERING THERE AMONG THE FIRS AND PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0069 THEIR GRANDEUR BEING IN THE MEAN TIME IN GREAT PART INVISIBLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0070 BUT TO THE LIVING EYE IT WILL BE MANIFESTED SOONER OR LATER STEALING SLOWLY ON THE SENSES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0071 LIKE THE GRANDEUR OF NIAGARA OR THE LOFTY YOSEMITE DOMES THEIR GREAT SIZE IS HIDDEN FROM THE INEXPERIENCED OBSERVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0072 AS LONG AS THEY ARE SEEN AT A DISTANCE IN ONE HARMONIOUS VIEW WHEN HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0073 YOU APPROACH THEM AND WALK ROUND THEM YOU BEGIN TO WONDER AT THEIR COLOSSAL SIZE AND SEEK A MEASURING ROD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0074 THESE GIANTS BULGE CONSIDERABLY AT THE BASE BUT NOT MORE THAN IS REQUIRED FOR BEAUTY AND SAFETY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0075 AND THE ONLY REASON THAT THIS BULGING SEEMS IN SOME CASES EXCESSIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0076 IS THAT ONLY A COMPARATIVELY SMALL SECTION OF THE SHAFT IS SEEN AT ONCE IN NEAR VIEWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0077 ONE THAT I MEASURED IN THE KING'S RIVER FOREST WAS TWENTY FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER AT THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0078 AND TEN FEET IN DIAMETER TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0079 SHOWING THAT THE TAPER OF THE TRUNK AS A WHOLE IS CHARMINGLY FINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0080 AND WHEN YOU STAND BACK FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE MASSIVE COLUMNS FROM THE SWELLING INSTEP
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0081 TO THE LOFTY SUMMIT DISSOLVING IN A DOME OF VERDURE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0082 YOU REJOICE IN THE UNRIVALED DISPLAY OF COMBINED GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0083 ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET OR MORE OF THE TRUNK IS USUALLY BRANCHLESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0084 BUT ITS MASSIVE SIMPLICITY IS RELIEVED BY THE BARK FURROWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0085 WHICH INSTEAD OF MAKING AN IRREGULAR NETWORK RUN EVENLY PARALLEL LIKE THE FLUTING OF AN ARCHITECTURAL COLUMN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0086 AND TO SOME EXTENT BY TUFTS OF SLENDER SPRAYS THAT WAVE LIGHTLY IN THE WINDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0087 AND CAST FLECKS OF SHADE SEEMING TO HAVE BEEN PINNED ON HERE AND THERE FOR THE SAKE OF BEAUTY ONLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0088 THE YOUNG TREES HAVE SLENDER SIMPLE BRANCHES DOWN TO THE GROUND PUT ON WITH STRICT REGULARITY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0089 SHARPLY ASPIRING AT THE TOP HORIZONTAL ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN AND DROOPING IN HANDSOME CURVES AT THE BASE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0090 BY THE TIME THE SAPLING IS FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED YEARS OLD THIS SPIRY FEATHERY JUVENILE HABIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0091 MERGES INTO THE FIRM ROUNDED DOME FORM OF MIDDLE AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0092 WHICH IN TURN TAKES ON THE ECCENTRIC PICTURESQUENESS OF OLD AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0093 NO OTHER TREE IN THE SIERRA FOREST HAS FOLIAGE SO DENSELY MASSED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0094 OR PRESENTS OUTLINES SO FIRMLY DRAWN AND SO STEADILY SUBORDINATE TO A SPECIAL TYPE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0095 A KNOTTY UNGOVERNABLE LOOKING BRANCH FIVE TO EIGHT FEET THICK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0096 MAY BE SEEN PUSHING OUT ABRUPTLY FROM THE SMOOTH TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0097 AS IF SURE TO THROW THE REGULAR CURVE INTO CONFUSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0098 BUT AS SOON AS THE GENERAL OUTLINE IS REACHED IT STOPS SHORT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0099 AND DISSOLVES IN SPREADING BOSSES OF LAW ABIDING SPRAYS JUST AS IF EVERY TREE WERE GROWING BENEATH SOME HUGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0100 INVISIBLE BELL GLASS AGAINST WHOSE SIDES EVERY BRANCH WAS BEING PRESSED AND MOLDED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0101 YET SOMEHOW INDULGING IN SO MANY SMALL DEPARTURES FROM THE REGULAR FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0102 THAT THERE IS STILL AN APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM THE FOLIAGE OF THE SAPLINGS IS DARK BLUISH GREEN IN COLOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0103 WHILE THE OLDER TREES RIPEN TO A WARM BROWNISH YELLOW TINT LIKE LIBOCEDRUS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0104 BARK IS RICH CINNAMON BROWN PURPLISH IN YOUNG TREES AND IN SHADY PORTIONS OF THE OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0105 WHILE THE GROUND IS COVERED WITH BROWN LEAVES AND BURS FORMING COLOR MASSES OF EXTRAORDINARY RICHNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0106 NOT TO MENTION THE FLOWERS AND UNDERBRUSH THAT REJOICE ABOUT THEM IN THEIR SEASONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0107 WALK THE SEQUOIA WOODS AT ANY TIME OF YEAR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0108 AND YOU WILL SAY THEY ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MAJESTIC ON EARTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0109 BEAUTIFUL AND IMPRESSIVE CONTRASTS MEET YOU EVERYWHERE THE COLORS OF TREE AND FLOWER ROCK AND SKY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0110 LIGHT AND SHADE STRENGTH AND FRAILTY ENDURANCE AND EVANESCENCE TANGLES OF SUPPLE HAZEL BUSHES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0111 TREE PILLARS ABOUT AS RIGID AS GRANITE DOMES ROSES AND VIOLETS THE SMALLEST OF THEIR KIND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0112 BLOOMING AROUND THE FEET OF THE GIANTS AND RUGS OF THE LOWLY CHAMAEBATIA WHERE THE SUNBEAMS FALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0113 THEN IN WINTER THE TREES THEMSELVES BREAK FORTH IN BLOOM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0114 MYRIADS OF SMALL FOUR SIDED STAMINATE CONES CROWD THE ENDS OF THE SLENDER SPRAYS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0115 COLORING THE WHOLE TREE AND WHEN RIPE DUSTING THE AIR AND THE GROUND WITH GOLDEN POLLEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0116 THE FERTILE CONES ARE BRIGHT GRASS GREEN MEASURING ABOUT TWO INCHES IN LENGTH BY ONE AND A HALF IN THICKNESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0118 WITH FROM FIVE TO EIGHT SEEDS AT THE BASE OF EACH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0119 A SINGLE CONE THEREFORE CONTAINS FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED SEEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0120 WHICH ARE ABOUT A FOURTH OF AN INCH LONG BY THREE SIXTEENTHS WIDE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0121 INCLUDING A THIN FLAT MARGIN THAT MAKES THEM GO GLANCING AND WAVERING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0122 IN THEIR FALL LIKE A BOY'S KITE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0123 THE FRUITFULNESS OF SEQUOIA MAY BE ILLUSTRATED BY TWO SPECIMEN BRANCHES ONE AND A HALF AND TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0124 ON WHICH I COUNTED FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CONES NO OTHER SIERRA CONIFER PRODUCES NEARLY SO MANY SEEDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0125 MILLIONS ARE RIPENED ANNUALLY BY A SINGLE TREE AND IN A FRUITFUL YEAR THE PRODUCT OF ONE OF THE NORTHERN GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0126 WOULD BE ENOUGH TO PLANT ALL THE MOUNTAIN RANGES OF THE WORLD NATURE TAKES CARE HOWEVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0127 THAT NOT ONE SEED IN A MILLION SHALL GERMINATE AT ALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0128 AND OF THOSE THAT DO PERHAPS NOT ONE IN TEN THOUSAND IS SUFFERED TO LIVE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0129 THROUGH THE MANY VICISSITUDES OF STORM DROUGHT FIRE AND SNOW CRUSHING THAT BESET THEIR YOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0130 THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL IS THE HAPPY HARVESTER OF MOST OF THE SEQUOIA CONES OUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0131 OF EVERY HUNDRED PERHAPS NINETY FALL TO HIS SHARE AND UNLESS CUT OFF BY HIS IVORY SICKLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0132 THEY SHAKE OUT THEIR SEEDS AND REMAIN ON THE TREE FOR MANY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0133 WATCHING THE SQUIRRELS AT THEIR HARVEST WORK IN THE INDIAN SUMMER IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL DIVERSIONS IMAGINABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0134 THE WOODS ARE CALM AND THE RIPE COLORS ARE BLAZING IN ALL THEIR GLORY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0135 THE CONE LADEN TREES STAND MOTIONLESS IN THE WARM HAZY AIR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0136 AND YOU MAY SEE THE CRIMSON CRESTED WOODCOCK THE PRINCE OF SIERRA WOODPECKERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0137 DRILLING SOME DEAD LIMB OR FALLEN TRUNK WITH HIS BILL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0138 AND EVER AND ANON FILLING THE GLENS WITH HIS HAPPY CACKLE THE HUMMING BIRD TOO
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0139 DWELLS IN THESE NOBLE WOODS AND MAY OFTENTIMES BE SEEN GLANCING AMONG THE FLOWERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0140 OR RESTING WING WEARY ON SOME LEAFLESS TWIG
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0141 HERE ALSO ARE THE FAMILIAR ROBIN OF THE ORCHARDS AND THE BROWN AND GRIZZLY BEARS SO OBVIOUSLY FITTED FOR THESE MAJESTIC SOLITUDES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0142 AND THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL MAKING MORE HILARIOUS EXUBERANT VITAL STIR THAN ALL THE BEARS BIRDS AND HUMMING WINGS TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0143 AS SOON AS ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENS TO THE CROWN OF THESE SEQUOIAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0144 SUCH AS BEING STRICKEN OFF BY LIGHTNING OR BROKEN BY STORMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0145 THEN THE BRANCHES BENEATH THE WOUND NO MATTER HOW SITUATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0146 SEEM TO BE EXCITED LIKE A COLONY OF BEES THAT HAVE LOST THEIR QUEEN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0147 BECOME ANXIOUS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE LIMBS THAT HAVE GROWN OUTWARD FOR CENTURIES AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0148 BEGIN TO TURN UPWARD TO ASSIST IN MAKING A NEW CROWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0149 EACH SPEEDILY ASSUMING THE SPECIAL FORM OF TRUE SUMMITS EVEN IN THE CASE OF MERE STUMPS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0150 BURNED HALF THROUGH SOME MERE ORNAMENTAL TUFT WILL TRY TO GO ALOFT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0151 AND DO ITS BEST AS A LEADER IN FORMING A NEW HEAD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0152 GROUPS OF TWO OR THREE OF THESE GRAND TREES ARE OFTEN FOUND STANDING CLOSE TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0153 THE SEEDS FROM WHICH THEY SPRANG HAVING PROBABLY GROWN ON GROUND CLEARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0154 BY THE FALL OF A LARGE TREE OF A FORMER GENERATION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0155 THESE PATCHES OF FRESH MELLOW SOIL BESIDE THE UPTURNED ROOTS OF THE FALLEN GIANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0156 MAY BE FROM FORTY TO SIXTY FEET WIDE AND THEY ARE SPEEDILY OCCUPIED BY SEEDLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0157 OUT OF THESE SEEDLING THICKETS PERHAPS TWO OR THREE MAY BECOME TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0158 FORMING THOSE CLOSE GROUPS CALLED THREE GRACES LOVING COUPLES ETC
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0159 FOR EVEN SUPPOSING THAT THE TREES SHOULD STAND TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET APART WHILE YOUNG
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0160 BY THE TIME THEY ARE FULL GROWN THEIR TRUNKS WILL TOUCH AND CROWD AGAINST EACH OTHER AND EVEN APPEAR AS ONE IN SOME CASES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0161 IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT THIS GRAND SEQUOIA WAS ONCE FAR MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED OVER THE SIERRA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0162 BUT AFTER LONG AND CAREFUL STUDY I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT NEVER WAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0163 AT LEAST SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD BECAUSE A DILIGENT SEARCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0164 ALONG THE MARGINS OF THE GROVES AND IN THE GAPS BETWEEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0165 FAILS TO REVEAL A SINGLE TRACE OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE BEYOND ITS PRESENT BOUNDS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0166 NOTWITHSTANDING I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IF EVERY SEQUOIA IN THE RANGE WERE TO DIE TO DAY NUMEROUS MONUMENTS OF THEIR EXISTENCE WOULD REMAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0167 OF SO IMPERISHABLE A NATURE AS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE STUDENT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND YEARS HENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0168 IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MIGHT NOTICE THAT NO SPECIES OF CONIFEROUS TREE IN THE RANGE KEEPS ITS INDIVIDUALS SO WELL TOGETHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0169 AS SEQUOIA A MILE IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF ANY STRAGGLER FROM THE MAIN BODY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0170 AND ALL OF THOSE STRAGGLERS THAT HAVE COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION ARE YOUNG INSTEAD OF OLD MONUMENTAL TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0171 RELICS OF A MORE EXTENDED GROWTH AGAIN SEQUOIA TRUNKS FREQUENTLY ENDURE FOR CENTURIES AFTER THEY FALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0172 I HAVE A SPECIMEN BLOCK CUT FROM A FALLEN TRUNK WHICH IS HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM SPECIMENS CUT FROM LIVING TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0173 ALTHOUGH THE OLD TRUNK FRAGMENT FROM WHICH IT WAS DERIVED HAS LAIN IN THE DAMP FOREST MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0174 PROBABLY THRICE AS LONG THE TIME MEASURE IN THE CASE IS SIMPLY THIS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0175 WHEN THE PONDEROUS TRUNK TO WHICH THE OLD VESTIGE BELONGED FELL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0176 IT SUNK ITSELF INTO THE GROUND THUS MAKING A LONG STRAIGHT DITCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0177 AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DITCH A SILVER FIR IS GROWING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0178 THAT IS NOW FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS OLD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0179 AS DETERMINED BY CUTTING IT HALF THROUGH AND COUNTING THE RINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0180 THUS DEMONSTRATING THAT THE REMNANT OF THE TRUNK THAT MADE THE DITCH HAS LAIN ON THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0181 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0182 FOR IT IS EVIDENT THAT TO FIND THE WHOLE TIME WE MUST ADD TO THE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0183 THE TIME THAT THE VANISHED PORTION OF THE TRUNK LAY IN THE DITCH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0184 BEFORE BEING BURNED OUT OF THE WAY PLUS THE TIME THAT PASSED BEFORE THE SEED FROM WHICH THE MONUMENTAL FIR SPRANG
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0185 FELL INTO THE PREPARED SOIL AND TOOK ROOT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0186 NOW BECAUSE SEQUOIA TRUNKS ARE NEVER WHOLLY CONSUMED IN ONE FOREST FIRE AND THOSE FIRES RECUR ONLY AT CONSIDERABLE INTERVALS AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0187 BECAUSE SEQUOIA DITCHES AFTER BEING CLEARED ARE OFTEN LEFT UNPLANTED FOR CENTURIES IT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0188 BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THE TRUNK REMNANT IN QUESTION MAY PROBABLY HAVE LAIN A THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0189 AND THIS INSTANCE IS BY NO MEANS A RARE ONE BUT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0190 ADMITTING THAT UPON THOSE AREAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN ONCE COVERED WITH SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0191 EVERY TREE MAY HAVE FALLEN AND EVERY TRUNK MAY HAVE BEEN BURNED OR BURIED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0192 LEAVING NOT A REMNANT MANY OF THE DITCHES MADE BY THE FALL OF THE PONDEROUS TRUNKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0193 AND THE BOWLS MADE BY THEIR UPTURNING ROOTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0194 WOULD REMAIN PATENT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AFTER THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE TRUNKS THAT MADE THEM HAD VANISHED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0195 MUCH OF THIS DITCH WRITING WOULD NO DOUBT BE QUICKLY EFFACED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0196 BY THE FLOOD ACTION OF OVERFLOWING STREAMS AND RAIN WASHING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0197 BUT NO INCONSIDERABLE PORTION WOULD REMAIN ENDURINGLY ENGRAVED ON RIDGE TOPS BEYOND SUCH DESTRUCTIVE ACTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0198 FOR WHERE ALL THE CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE IT IS ALMOST IMPERISHABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0199 NOW THESE HISTORIC DITCHES AND ROOT BOWLS OCCUR IN ALL THE PRESENT SEQUOIA GROVES AND FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0200 BUT AS FAR AS I HAVE OBSERVED NOT THE FAINTEST VESTIGE OF ONE PRESENTS ITSELF OUTSIDE OF THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0201 WE THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT THE AREA COVERED BY SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0202 HAS NOT BEEN DIMINISHED DURING THE LAST EIGHT OR TEN THOUSAND YEARS AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0203 PROBABLY NOT AT ALL IN POST GLACIAL TIMES IS THE SPECIES VERGING TO EXTINCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0204 WHAT ARE ITS RELATIONS TO CLIMATE SOIL AND ASSOCIATED TREES ALL THE PHENOMENA BEARING ON THESE QUESTIONS ALSO THROW LIGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0205 AS WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO SHOW UPON THE PECULIAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0206 AND SUSTAIN THE CONCLUSION ALREADY ARRIVED AT ON THE QUESTION OF EXTENSION IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0207 THE NORTHERN GROUPS AS WE HAVE SEEN THERE ARE FEW YOUNG TREES OR SAPLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0208 GROWING UP AROUND THE FAILING OLD ONES TO PERPETUATE THE RACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0209 AND IN AS MUCH AS THOSE AGED SEQUOIAS SO NEARLY CHILDLESS ARE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0210 THE ONLY ONES COMMONLY KNOWN THE SPECIES TO MOST OBSERVERS SEEMS DOOMED TO SPEEDY EXTINCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0211 AS BEING NOTHING MORE THAN AN EXPIRING REMNANT VANQUISHED IN THE SO CALLED STRUGGLE FOR LIFE BY PINES AND FIRS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0212 THAT HAVE DRIVEN IT INTO ITS LAST STRONGHOLDS IN MOIST GLENS WHERE CLIMATE IS EXCEPTIONALLY FAVORABLE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0213 BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE MAJESTIC CONTINUOUS FORESTS OF THE SOUTH CREATES A VERY DIFFERENT IMPRESSION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0214 NO TREE OF ALL THE FOREST IS MORE ENDURINGLY ESTABLISHED IN CONCORDANCE WITH CLIMATE AND SOIL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0215 IT GROWS HEARTILY EVERYWHERE ON MORAINES ROCKY LEDGES ALONG WATERCOURSES AND IN THE DEEP MOIST ALLUVIUM OF MEADOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0216 WITH A MULTITUDE OF SEEDLINGS AND SAPLINGS CROWDING UP AROUND THE AGED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0217 SEEMINGLY ABUNDANTLY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE FOREST IN PRIME VIGOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0218 FOR EVERY OLD STORM STRICKEN TREE THERE IS ONE OR MORE IN ALL THE GLORY OF PRIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0219 AND FOR EACH OF THESE MANY YOUNG TREES AND CROWDS OF EXUBERANT SAPLINGS SO THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0220 IF ALL THE TREES OF ANY SECTION OF THE MAIN SEQUOIA FOREST WERE RANGED TOGETHER ACCORDING TO AGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0221 A VERY PROMISING CURVE WOULD BE PRESENTED ALL THE WAY UP FROM LAST YEAR'S SEEDLINGS TO GIANTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0222 AND WITH THE YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED PORTION OF THE CURVE MANY TIMES LONGER THAN THE OLD PORTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0223 EVEN AS FAR NORTH AS THE FRESNO I COUNTED FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX SAPLINGS AND SEEDLINGS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0224 GROWING PROMISINGLY UPON A PIECE OF ROUGH AVALANCHE SOIL NOT EXCEEDING TWO ACRES IN AREA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0225 THIS SOIL BED IS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HAS BEEN SEEDED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY BY PINES FIRS LIBOCEDRUS AND SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0226 PRESENTING A SIMPLE AND INSTRUCTIVE ILLUSTRATION OF THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE AMONG THE RIVAL SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0227 AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE CONDITIONS THUS FAR AFFECTING THEM HAVE ENABLED THE YOUNG SEQUOIAS TO GAIN A MARKED ADVANTAGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0228 IN EVERY INSTANCE LIKE THE ABOVE I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE SEEDLING SEQUOIA IS CAPABLE OF GROWING ON BOTH DRIER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0229 AND WETTER SOIL THAN ITS RIVALS BUT REQUIRES MORE SUNSHINE THAN THEY THE LATTER FACT BEING CLEARLY SHOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0230 WHEREVER A SUGAR PINE OR FIR IS GROWING IN CLOSE CONTACT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0231 WITH A SEQUOIA OF ABOUT EQUAL AGE AND SIZE AND EQUALLY EXPOSED TO THE SUN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0232 THE BRANCHES OF THE LATTER IN SUCH CASES ARE ALWAYS LESS LEAFY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0233 TOWARD THE SOUTH HOWEVER WHERE THE SEQUOIA BECOMES MORE EXUBERANT AND NUMEROUS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0234 THE RIVAL TREES BECOME LESS SO AND WHERE THEY MIX WITH SEQUOIAS THEY MOSTLY GROW UP BENEATH THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0235 LIKE SLENDER GRASSES AMONG STALKS OF INDIAN CORN UPON A BED OF SANDY FLOOD SOIL I COUNTED NINETY FOUR SEQUOIAS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0236 FROM ONE TO TWELVE FEET HIGH ON A PATCH OF GROUND ONCE OCCUPIED BY FOUR LARGE SUGAR PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0237 WHICH LAY CRUMBLING BENEATH THEM AN INSTANCE OF CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE ENABLED SEQUOIAS TO CROWD OUT THE PINES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0238 I ALSO NOTED EIGHTY SIX VIGOROUS SAPLINGS UPON A PIECE OF FRESH GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0239 PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION BY FIRE THUS FIRE THE GREAT DESTROYER OF SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0240 ALSO FURNISHES BARE VIRGIN GROUND ONE OF THE CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL FOR ITS GROWTH FROM THE SEED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0241 FRESH GROUND IS HOWEVER FURNISHED IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FOR THE CONSTANT RENEWAL OF THE FORESTS WITHOUT FIRE VIZ BY THE FALL OF OLD TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0242 THE SOIL IS THUS UPTURNED AND MELLOWED AND MANY TREES ARE PLANTED FOR EVERY ONE THAT FALLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0243 LAND SLIPS AND FLOODS ALSO GIVE RISE TO BARE VIRGIN GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0244 AND A TREE NOW AND THEN OWES ITS EXISTENCE TO A BURROWING WOLF OR SQUIRREL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0245 BUT THE MOST REGULAR SUPPLY OF FRESH SOIL IS FURNISHED BY THE FALL OF AGED TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0246 THE CLIMATIC CHANGES IN PROGRESS IN THE SIERRA BEARING ON THE TENURE OF TREE LIFE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0247 ARE ENTIRELY MISAPPREHENDED ESPECIALLY AS TO THE TIME AND THE MEANS EMPLOYED BY NATURE IN EFFECTING THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0248 IT IS CONSTANTLY ASSERTED IN A VAGUE WAY THAT THE SIERRA WAS VASTLY WETTER THAN NOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0249 AND THAT THE INCREASING DROUGHT WILL OF ITSELF EXTINGUISH SEQUOIA LEAVING ITS GROUND TO OTHER TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0250 SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF NOURISHING IN A DRIER CLIMATE BUT THAT SEQUOIA CAN AND DOES GROW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0251 ON AS DRY GROUND AS ANY OF ITS PRESENT RIVALS IS MANIFEST IN A THOUSAND PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0252 WHY THEN IT WILL BE ASKED ARE SEQUOIAS ALWAYS FOUND IN GREATEST ABUNDANCE IN WELL WATERED PLACES WHERE STREAMS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY ABUNDANT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0253 SIMPLY BECAUSE A GROWTH OF SEQUOIAS CREATES THOSE STREAMS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0254 THE THIRSTY MOUNTAINEER KNOWS WELL THAT IN EVERY SEQUOIA GROVE HE WILL FIND RUNNING WATER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0255 BUT IT IS A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE WATER IS THE CAUSE OF THE GROVE BEING THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0256 ON THE CONTRARY THE GROVE IS THE CAUSE OF THE WATER BEING THERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0257 DRAIN OFF THE WATER AND THE TREES WILL REMAIN BUT CUT OFF THE TREES AND THE STREAMS WILL VANISH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0258 NEVER WAS CAUSE MORE COMPLETELY MISTAKEN FOR EFFECT THAN IN THE CASE OF THESE RELATED PHENOMENA OF SEQUOIA WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0259 AND PERENNIAL STREAMS AND I CONFESS THAT AT FIRST I SHARED IN THE BLUNDER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0260 WHEN ATTENTION IS CALLED TO THE METHOD OF SEQUOIA STREAM MAKING IT WILL BE APPREHENDED AT ONCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0261 THE ROOTS OF THIS IMMENSE TREE FILL THE GROUND FORMING A THICK SPONGE THAT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0262 ABSORBS AND HOLDS BACK THE RAINS AND MELTING SNOWS ONLY ALLOWING THEM TO OOZE AND FLOW GENTLY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0263 INDEED EVERY FALLEN LEAF AND ROOTLET AS WELL AS LONG CLASPING ROOT AND PROSTRATE TRUNK
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0264 MAY BE REGARDED AS A DAM HOARDING THE BOUNTY OF STORM CLOUDS AND DISPENSING IT AS BLESSINGS ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0265 INSTEAD OF ALLOWING IT TO GO HEADLONG IN SHORT LIVED FLOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0266 EVAPORATION IS ALSO CHECKED BY THE DENSE FOLIAGE TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN BY ANY OTHER SIERRA TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0267 AND THE AIR IS ENTANGLED IN MASSES AND BROAD SHEETS THAT ARE QUICKLY SATURATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0268 WHILE THIRSTY WINDS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO SPONGING AND LICKING ALONG THE GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0269 SO GREAT IS THE RETENTION OF WATER IN MANY PLACES IN THE MAIN BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0270 THAT BOGS AND MEADOWS ARE CREATED BY THE KILLING OF THE TREES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0271 A SINGLE TRUNK FALLING ACROSS A STREAM IN THE WOODS FORMS A DAM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0272 TWO HUNDRED FEET LONG AND FROM TEN TO THIRTY FEET HIGH GIVING RISE TO A POND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0273 WHICH KILLS THE TREES WITHIN ITS REACH THESE DEAD TREES FALL IN TURN THUS MAKING A CLEARING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0274 WHILE SEDIMENTS GRADUALLY ACCUMULATE CHANGING THE POND INTO A BOG OR MEADOW FOR A
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0275 GROWTH OF CARICES AND SPHAGNUM IN SOME INSTANCES A SERIES OF SMALL BOGS OR MEADOWS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0276 RISE ABOVE ONE ANOTHER ON A HILLSIDE WHICH ARE GRADUALLY MERGED INTO ONE ANOTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0277 FORMING SLOPING BOGS OR MEADOWS WHICH MAKE STRIKING FEATURES OF SEQUOIA WOODS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0278 AND SINCE ALL THE TREES THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO THEM HAVE BEEN PRESERVED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0279 THEY CONTAIN RECORDS OF THE GENERATIONS THAT HAVE PASSED SINCE THEY BEGAN TO FORM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0280 SINCE THEN IT IS A FACT THAT THOUSANDS OF SEQUOIAS ARE GROWING THRIFTILY ON WHAT IS TERMED DRY GROUND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0281 AND EVEN CLINGING LIKE MOUNTAIN PINES TO RIFTS IN GRANITE PRECIPICES AND SINCE IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0282 THAT THE EXTRA MOISTURE FOUND IN CONNECTION WITH THE DENSER GROWTHS IS AN EFFECT OF THEIR PRESENCE INSTEAD OF A CAUSE OF THEIR PRESENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0283 THEN THE NOTIONS AS TO THE FORMER EXTENSION OF THE SPECIES AND ITS NEAR APPROACH TO EXTINCTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0284 BASED UPON ITS SUPPOSED DEPENDENCE ON GREATER MOISTURE ARE SEEN TO BE ERRONEOUS THE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0285 DECREASE IN THE RAIN AND SNOW FALL SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD IN THE SIERRA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0286 IS MUCH LESS THAN IS COMMONLY GUESSED THE HIGHEST POST GLACIAL WATERMARKS ARE WELL PRESERVED IN ALL THE UPPER RIVER CHANNELS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0287 AND THEY ARE NOT GREATLY HIGHER THAN THE SPRING FLOODMARKS OF THE PRESENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0288 SHOWING CONCLUSIVELY THAT NO EXTRAORDINARY DECREASE HAS TAKEN PLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0289 IN THE VOLUME OF THE UPPER TRIBUTARIES OF POST GLACIAL SIERRA STREAMS SINCE THEY CAME INTO EXISTENCE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0290 BUT IN THE MEAN TIME ELIMINATING ALL THIS COMPLICATED QUESTION OF CLIMATIC CHANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0291 THE PLAIN FACT REMAINS THAT THE PRESENT RAIN AND SNOW FALL IS ABUNDANTLY SUFFICIENT FOR
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0292 THE LUXURIANT GROWTH OF SEQUOIA FORESTS INDEED ALL MY OBSERVATIONS TEND TO SHOW
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0293 THAT IN A PROLONGED DROUGHT THE SUGAR PINES AND FIRS WOULD PERISH BEFORE THE SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0294 NOT ALONE BECAUSE OF THE GREATER LONGEVITY OF INDIVIDUAL TREES BUT BECAUSE THE SPECIES CAN ENDURE MORE DROUGHT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0295 AND MAKE THE MOST OF WHATEVER MOISTURE FALLS AGAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0296 IF THE RESTRICTION AND IRREGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES BE INTERPRETED AS A RESULT OF THE DESICCATION OF THE RANGE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0297 THEN INSTEAD OF INCREASING AS IT DOES IN INDIVIDUALS TOWARD THE SOUTH WHERE THE RAINFALL IS LESS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0298 IT SHOULD DIMINISH IF THEN THE PECULIAR DISTRIBUTION OF SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0299 HAS NOT BEEN GOVERNED BY SUPERIOR CONDITIONS OF SOIL AS TO FERTILITY OR MOISTURE BY WHAT HAS IT BEEN GOVERNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0300 IN THE COURSE OF MY STUDIES I OBSERVED THAT THE NORTHERN GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0301 THE ONLY ONES I WAS AT FIRST ACQUAINTED WITH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0302 WERE LOCATED ON JUST THOSE PORTIONS OF THE GENERAL FOREST SOIL BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0303 THAT WERE FIRST LAID BARE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0304 WHEN THE ICE SHEET BEGAN TO BREAK UP INTO INDIVIDUAL GLACIERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0305 AND WHILE SEARCHING THE WIDE BASIN OF THE SAN JOAQUIN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0306 TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ABSENCE OF SEQUOIA WHERE EVERY CONDITION SEEMED FAVORABLE FOR ITS GROWTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0307 IT OCCURED TO ME THAT THIS REMARKABLE GAP IN THE SEQUOIA BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0308 IS LOCATED EXACTLY IN THE BASIN OF THE VAST ANCIENT MER DE GLACE OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0309 AND KING'S RIVER BASINS WHICH POURED ITS FROZEN FLOODS TO THE PLAIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0310 FED BY THE SNOWS THAT FELL ON MORE THAN FIFTY MILES OF THE SUMMIT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0311 I THEN PERCEIVED THAT THE NEXT GREAT GAP IN THE BELT TO THE NORTHWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0312 FORTY MILES WIDE EXTENDING BETWEEN THE CALAVERAS AND TUOLUMNE GROVES OCCURS IN THE BASIN OF THE GREAT ANCIENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0313 MER DE GLACE OF THE TUOLUMNE AND STANISLAUS BASINS AND THAT THE SMALLER GAP BETWEEN THE MERCED AND MARIPOSA GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0314 OCCURS IN THE BASIN OF THE SMALLER GLACIER OF THE MERCED THE WIDER THE ANCIENT GLACIER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0315 THE WIDER THE CORRESPONDING GAP IN THE SEQUOIA BELT FINALLY PURSUING MY INVESTIGATIONS ACROSS THE BASINS OF THE KAWEAH AND TULE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0316 I DISCOVERED THAT THE SEQUOIA BELT ATTAINED ITS GREATEST DEVELOPMENT JUST WHERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0317 OWING TO THE TOPOGRAPHICAL PECULIARITIES OF THE REGION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0318 THE GROUND HAD BEEN MOST PERFECTLY PROTECTED FROM THE MAIN ICE RIVERS THAT CONTINUED TO POUR PAST FROM THE SUMMIT FOUNTAINS LONG AFTER THE SMALLER LOCAL GLACIERS HAD BEEN MELTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0319 TAKING NOW A GENERAL VIEW OF THE BELT BEGINNING AT THE SOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0320 WE SEE THAT THE MAJESTIC ANCIENT GLACIERS WERE SHED OFF RIGHT AND LEFT DOWN THE VALLEYS OF KERN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0321 AND KING'S RIVERS BY THE LOFTY PROTECTIVE SPURS OUTSPREAD EMBRACINGLY ABOVE THE WARM SEQUOIA FILLED BASINS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0322 OF THE KAWEAH AND TULE THEN NEXT NORTHWARD OCCURS THE WIDE SEQUOIA LESS CHANNEL OR BASIN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0323 OF THE ANCIENT SAN JOAQUIN AND KING'S RIVER MER DE GLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0324 THEN THE WARM PROTECTED SPOTS OF FRESNO AND MARIPOSA GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0325 THEN THE SEQUOIA LESS CHANNEL OF THE ANCIENT MERCED GLACIER NEXT THE WARM SHELTERED GROUND OF THE MERCED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0326 AND TUOLUMNE GROVES THEN THE SEQUOIA LESS CHANNEL OF THE GRAND ANCIENT MER DE GLACE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0327 OF THE TUOLUMNE AND STANISLAUS THEN THE WARM OLD GROUND OF THE CALAVERAS AND STANISLAUS GROVES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0328 IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT JUST WHERE AT A CERTAIN PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE SIERRA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0329 THE GLACIERS WERE NOT THERE THE SEQUOIA IS AND JUST WHERE THE GLACIERS WERE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0330 THERE THE SEQUOIA IS NOT WHAT THE OTHER CONDITIONS MAY HAVE BEEN THAT ENABLED SEQUOIA TO ESTABLISH ITSELF UPON THESE OLDEST
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0331 AND WARMEST PORTIONS OF THE MAIN GLACIAL SOIL BELT I CANNOT SAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0332 I MIGHT VENTURE TO STATE HOWEVER IN THIS CONNECTION
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0333 THAT SINCE THE SEQUOIA FORESTS PRESENT A MORE AND MORE ANCIENT ASPECT AS THEY EXTEND SOUTHWARD
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0334 I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE SPECIES WAS DISTRIBUTED FROM THE SOUTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0335 WHILE THE SUGAR PINE ITS GREAT RIVAL IN THE NORTHERN GROVES SEEMS TO HAVE COME AROUND THE HEAD OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0336 AND DOWN THE SIERRA FROM THE NORTH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0337 CONSEQUENTLY WHEN THE SIERRA SOIL BEDS WERE FIRST THROWN OPEN TO PREEMPTION ON THE MELTING OF THE ICE SHEET
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0338 THE SEQUOIA MAY HAVE ESTABLISHED ITSELF ALONG THE AVAILABLE PORTIONS OF THE SOUTH HALF OF THE RANGE PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE SUGAR PINE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0339 WHILE THE SUGAR PINE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE NORTH HALF PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF SEQUOIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0340 BUT HOWEVER MUCH UNCERTAINTY MAY ATTACH TO THIS BRANCH OF THE QUESTION THERE ARE NO OBSCURING SHADOWS UPON THE GRAND GENERAL RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE POINTED OUT BETWEEN THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF SEQUOIA AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0341 THE ANCIENT GLACIERS OF THE SIERRA AND WHEN WE BEAR IN MIND THAT ALL THE PRESENT FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE YOUNG
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0342 GROWING ON MORAINE SOIL RECENTLY DEPOSITED AND THAT THE FLANK OF THE RANGE ITSELF
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0343 WITH ALL ITS LANDSCAPES IS NEW BORN RECENTLY SCULPTURED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0344 AND BROUGHT TO THE LIGHT OF DAY FROM BENEATH THE ICE MANTLE OF THE GLACIAL WINTER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0345 THEN A THOUSAND LAWLESS MYSTERIES DISAPPEAR AND BROAD HARMONIES TAKE THEIR PLACES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0346 BUT ALTHOUGH ALL THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA BEARING ON THE POST GLACIAL HISTORY OF THIS COLOSSAL TREE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0347 POINT TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT NEVER WAS MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0348 ON THE SIERRA SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE GLACIAL EPOCH THAT ITS PRESENT FORESTS ARE SCARCELY PAST PRIME
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0349 IF INDEED THEY HAVE REACHED PRIME THAT THE POST GLACIAL DAY OF THE SPECIES IS PROBABLY NOT HALF DONE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0350 YET WHEN FROM A WIDER OUTLOOK THE VAST ANTIQUITY OF THE GENUS IS CONSIDERED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0351 AND ITS ANCIENT RICHNESS IN SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS COMPARING OUR SIERRA GIANT AND SEQUOIA SEMPERVIRENS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0352 OF THE COAST RANGE THE ONLY OTHER LIVING SPECIES OF SEQUOIA WITH THE TWELVE FOSSIL SPECIES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0353 ALREADY DISCOVERED AND DESCRIBED BY HEER AND LESQUEREUX SOME OF WHICH SEEM TO HAVE FLOURISHED OVER VAST AREAS IN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0354 THE ARCTIC REGIONS AND IN EUROPE AND OUR OWN TERRITORIES DURING TERTIARY AND CRETACEOUS TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0355 THEN INDEED IT BECOMES PLAIN THAT OUR TWO SURVIVING SPECIES RESTRICTED TO NARROW BELTS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF CALIFORNIA
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0356 ARE MERE REMNANTS OF THE GENUS BOTH AS TO SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0357 AND THAT THEY PROBABLY ARE VERGING TO EXTINCTION BUT THE VERGE OF A PERIOD BEGINNING IN CRETACEOUS TIMES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0358 MAY HAVE A BREADTH OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS NOT TO MENTION THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF CONDITIONS CALCULATED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0359 TO MULTIPLY AND REEXTEND BOTH SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS THIS HOWEVER IS A BRANCH OF THE QUESTION INTO WHICH
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0360 I DO NOT NOW PURPOSE TO ENTER IN STUDYING THE FATE OF OUR FOREST KING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0361 WE HAVE THUS FAR CONSIDERED THE ACTION OF PURELY NATURAL CAUSES ONLY BUT UNFORTUNATELY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0362 MAN IS IN THE WOODS AND WASTE AND PURE DESTRUCTION ARE MAKING RAPID HEADWAY
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0363 IF THE IMPORTANCE OF FORESTS WERE AT ALL UNDERSTOOD EVEN FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0364 THEIR PRESERVATION WOULD CALL FORTH THE MOST WATCHFUL ATTENTION OF GOVERNMENT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0365 ONLY OF LATE YEARS BY MEANS OF FOREST RESERVATIONS HAS THE SIMPLEST GROUNDWORK FOR AVAILABLE LEGISLATION BEEN LAID
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0366 WHILE IN MANY OF THE FINEST GROVES EVERY SPECIES OF DESTRUCTION IS STILL MOVING ON
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0367 WITH ACCELERATED SPEED IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATIONS I FOUND NO FEWER THAN FIVE MILLS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0368 LOCATED ON OR NEAR THE LOWER EDGE OF THE SEQUOIA BELT
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0369 ALL OF WHICH WERE CUTTING CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF BIG TREE LUMBER MOST OF THE FRESNO GROUP
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0370 ARE DOOMED TO FEED THE MILLS RECENTLY ERECTED NEAR THEM
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0371 AND A COMPANY OF LUMBERMEN ARE NOW CUTTING THE MAGNIFICENT FOREST ON KING'S RIVER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0372 IN THESE MILLING OPERATIONS WASTE FAR EXCEEDS USE
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0373 FOR AFTER THE CHOICE YOUNG MANAGEABLE TREES ON ANY GIVEN SPOT HAVE BEEN FELLED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0374 THE WOODS ARE FIRED TO CLEAR THE GROUND OF LIMBS AND REFUSE WITH REFERENCE TO FURTHER OPERATIONS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0375 AND OF COURSE MOST OF THE SEEDLINGS AND SAPLINGS ARE DESTROYED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0376 THESE MILL RAVAGES HOWEVER ARE SMALL AS COMPARED WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY SHEEPMEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0377 INCREDIBLE NUMBERS OF SHEEP ARE DRIVEN TO THE MOUNTAIN PASTURES EVERY SUMMER AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0378 THEIR COURSE IS EVER MARKED BY DESOLATION EVERY WILD GARDEN IS TRODDEN DOWN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0379 THE SHRUBS ARE STRIPPED OF LEAVES AS IF DEVOURED BY LOCUSTS AND THE WOODS ARE BURNED
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0380 RUNNING FIRES ARE SET EVERYWHERE WITH A VIEW TO CLEARING THE GROUND OF PROSTRATE TRUNKS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0381 TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE FLOCKS AND IMPROVE THE PASTURES
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0382 THE ENTIRE FOREST BELT IS THUS SWEPT AND DEVASTATED FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF THE RANGE TO THE OTHER
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0383 AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RESINOUS PINUS CONTORTA SEQUOIA SUFFERS MOST OF ALL
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0384 INDIANS BURN OFF THE UNDERBRUSH IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES TO FACILITATE DEER HUNTING MOUNTAINEERS AND LUMBERMEN
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0385 CARELESSLY ALLOW THEIR CAMP FIRES TO RUN BUT THE FIRES OF THE SHEEPMEN OR MUTTONEERS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0386 FORM MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT OF ALL DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THAT RANGE THE SIERRA FORESTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0387 IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUR FOREST KING MIGHT LIVE ON GLORIOUSLY IN NATURE'S KEEPING
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0388 IT IS RAPIDLY VANISHING BEFORE THE FIRE AND STEEL OF MAN AND
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0389 UNLESS PROTECTIVE MEASURES BE SPEEDILY INVENTED AND APPLIED IN A FEW DECADES AT THE FARTHEST
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0390 ALL THAT WILL BE LEFT OF SEQUOIA GIGANTEA WILL BE A FEW HACKED AND SCARRED MONUMENTS
knotyouraveragejo-20080525-mt2-mtn0391 END OF CHAPTER EIGHT PART TWO
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
koutakurugi-20100509-mls-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
kpeysin-20090212-syj-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
kristenwegner-20120217-gdx-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
laserbeams-20081202-dcx-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
laserbeams-20081202-hgu-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
laserbeams-20081202-knp-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0235 RAOUL YELLED IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0236 OOLONG WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0237 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
laserbeams-20081202-lvo-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
laserbeams-20081202-sun-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
laserbeams-20081202-yih-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
laserbeams-20081202-yya-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
laserbeams-20081202-yya-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
laserbeams-20081202-yya-b0232 IT WAS A SUPERB PICTURE
laserbeams-20081202-yya-b0233 SO SHE SAID THE IRATE SKIPPER DASHED ON
laserbeams-20081202-yya-b0234 AND WATCH OUT FOR WET FEET WAS HIS PARTING ADVICE

leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0004 HAVING SPOKEN OF THE GENERATION FORM AND POWER OF A COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0005 I AM IN ORDER TO SPEAK NEXT OF THE PARTS THEREOF AND FIRST OF SYSTEMS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0006 WHICH RESEMBLE THE SIMILAR PARTS OR MUSCLES OF A BODY NATURAL BY SYSTEMS I UNDERSTAND ANY NUMBERS OF MEN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0007 JOINED IN ONE INTEREST OR ONE BUSINESS OF WHICH SOME ARE REGULAR AND SOME IRREGULAR
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0008 REGULAR ARE THOSE WHERE ONE MAN OR ASSEMBLY OF MEN IS CONSTITUTED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WHOLE NUMBER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0009 ALL OTHER ARE IRREGULAR OF REGULAR SOME ARE ABSOLUTE AND INDEPENDENT SUBJECT TO NONE BUT THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0010 SUCH ARE ONLY COMMON WEALTHS OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN ALREADY IN THE FIVE LAST PRECEDING CHAPTERS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0011 OTHERS ARE DEPENDENT THAT IS TO SAY SUBORDINATE TO SOME SOVEREIGN POWER TO WHICH EVERY ONE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0012 AS ALSO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS SUBJECT OF SYSTEMS SUBORDINATE SOME ARE POLITICAL AND SOME PRIVATE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0013 POLITICAL OTHERWISE CALLED BODIES POLITIC AND PERSONS IN LAW
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0014 ARE THOSE WHICH ARE MADE BY AUTHORITY FROM THE SOVEREIGN POWER OF THE COMMON WEALTH

leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0022 ARE LAWFUL BUT WHEN THE INTENTION IS EVIL OR IF THE NUMBER BE CONSIDERABLE UNKNOWN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0023 THEY ARE UNLAWFUL IN BODIES POLITIC THE POWER OF THE REPRESENTATIVE IS ALWAYS LIMITED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0024 AND THAT WHICH PRESCRIBETH THE LIMITS THEREOF IS THE POWER SOVEREIGN FOR POWER UNLIMITED IS ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY AND
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0025 THE SOVEREIGN IN EVERY COMMONWEALTH IS THE ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL THE SUBJECTS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0026 AND THEREFORE NO OTHER CAN BE REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY PART OF THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0027 BUT SO FAR FORTH AS HE SHALL GIVE LEAVE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0028 AND TO GIVE LEAVE TO A BODY POLITIC OF SUBJECTS TO HAVE AN ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATIVE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0029 TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES WERE TO ABANDON THE GOVERNMENT OF SO MUCH OF THE COMMONWEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0030 AND TO DIVIDE THE DOMINION CONTRARY TO THEIR PEACE AND DEFENSE WHICH THE SOVEREIGN CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD TO DOE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0031 BY ANY GRANT THAT DOES NOT PLAINLY AND DIRECTLY DISCHARGE THEM OF THEIR SUBJECTION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0032 FOR CONSEQUENCES OF WORDS ARE NOT THE SIGNS OF HIS WILL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0033 WHEN OTHER CONSEQUENCES ARE SIGNS OF THE CONTRARY BUT RATHER SIGNS OF ERROR AND MISRECKONING
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0034 TO WHICH ALL MANKIND IS TOO PRONE THE BOUNDS OF THAT POWER WHICH IS GIVEN TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0035 ARE TO BE TAKEN NOTICE OF FROM TWO THINGS ONE IS THEIR WRIT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0036 OR LETTERS FROM THE SOVEREIGN THE OTHER IS THE LAW OF THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0037 FOR THOUGH IN THE INSTITUTION OR ACQUISITION OF A COMMON WEALTH WHICH IS INDEPENDENT THERE NEEDS NO WRITING
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0038 BECAUSE THE POWER OF THE REPRESENTATIVE HAS THERE NO OTHER BOUNDS BUT SUCH AS ARE SET OUT BY THE UNWRITTEN LAW OF NATURE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0039 YET IN SUBORDINATE BODIES THERE ARE SUCH DIVERSITIES OF LIMITATION NECESSARY CONCERNING THEIR BUSINESS TIMES AND PLACES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0040 AS CAN NEITHER BE REMEMBERED WITHOUT LETTERS NOR TAKEN NOTICE OF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0041 UNLESS SUCH LETTERS BE PATENT THAT THEY MAY BE READ TO THEM AND WITHALL SEALED OR TESTIFIED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0042 WITH THE SEALS OR OTHER PERMANENT SIGNS OF THE AUTHORITY SOVEREIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0043 AND BECAUSE SUCH LIMITATION IS NOT ALWAYS EASY OR PERHAPS POSSIBLE TO BE DESCRIBED IN WRITING
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0044 THE ORDINARY LAWS COMMON TO ALL SUBJECTS MUST DETERMINE THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE MAY LAWFULLY DO
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0045 IN ALL CASES WHERE THE LETTERS THEMSELVES ARE SILENT AND THEREFORE IN A BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0046 IF THE REPRESENTATIVE BE ONE MAN WHATSOEVER HE DOES IN THE PERSON OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0047 WHICH IS NOT WARRANTED IN HIS LETTERS NOR BY THE LAWS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0048 IS HIS OWN ACT AND NOT THE ACT OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0049 NOR OF ANY OTHER MEMBER THEREOF BESIDES HIMSELF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0050 BECAUSE FURTHER THAN HIS LETTERS OR THE LAWS LIMIT HE REPRESENTETH NO MANS PERSON BUT HIS OWN BUT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0051 WHAT HE DOES ACCORDING TO THESE IS THE ACT OF EVERY ONE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0052 FOR OF THE ACT OF THE SOVEREIGN EVERY ONE IS AUTHOR BECAUSE HE IS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE UNLIMITED AND
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0053 THE ACT OF HIM THAT RECEDES NOT FROM THE LETTERS OF THE SOVEREIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0054 IS THE ACT OF THE SOVEREIGN AND THEREFORE EVERY MEMBER OF THE BODY IS AUTHOR OF IT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0055 BUT IF THE REPRESENTATIVE BE AN ASSEMBLY WHATSOEVER THAT ASSEMBLY SHALL DECREE NOT WARRANTED BY THEIR LETTERS OR THE LAWS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0056 IS THE ACT OF THE ASSEMBLY OR BODY POLITIC AND THE ACT OF EVERY ONE BY WHOSE VOTE THE DECREE WAS MADE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0057 BUT NOT THE ACT OF ANY MAN THAT BEING PRESENT VOTED TO THE CONTRARY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0058 NOR OF ANY MAN ABSENT UNLESS HE VOTED IT BY PROCURATION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0059 IT IS THE ACT OF THE ASSEMBLY BECAUSE VOTED BY THE MAJOR PART
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0060 AND IF IT BE A CRIME THE ASSEMBLY MAY BE PUNISHED AS FAR FORTH AS IT IS CAPABLE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0061 AS BY DISSOLUTION OR FORFEITURE OF THEIR LETTERS WHICH IS TO SUCH ARTIFICIAL AND FICTITIOUS BODIES CAPITAL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0062 OR IF THE ASSEMBLY HAVE A COMMON STOCK WHEREIN NONE OF THE INNOCENT MEMBERS HAVE PROPRIETY BY PECUNIARY MULCT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0063 FOR FROM CORPORAL PENALTIES NATURE HATH EXEMPTED ALL BODIES POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0064 BUT THEY THAT GAVE NOT THEIR VOTE ARE THEREFORE INNOCENT BECAUSE THE ASSEMBLY CANNOT REPRESENT ANY MAN IN THINGS UNWARRANTED BY THEIR LETTERS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0065 AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THEIR VOTES IF THE PERSON OF THE BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0066 BEING IN ONE MAN BORROW MONEY OF A STRANGER THAT IS OF ONE THAT IS NOT OF THE SAME BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0067 FOR NO LETTERS NEED LIMIT BORROWING SEEING IT IS LEFT TO MENS OWN INCLINATIONS TO LIMIT LENDING
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0068 THE DEBT IS THE REPRESENTATIVES FOR IF HE SHOULD HAVE AUTHORITY FROM HIS LETTERS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0069 TO MAKE THE MEMBERS PAY WHAT HE BORROWETH HE SHOULD HAVE BY CONSEQUENCE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0070 AND THEREFORE THE GRANT WERE EITHER VOYD AS PROCEEDING FROM ERROR COMMONLY INCIDENT TO HUMANE NATURE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0071 AND AN INSUFFICIENT SIGN OF THE WILL OF THE GRANTER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0072 OR IF IT BE AVOWED BY HIM THEN IS THE REPRESENTER SOVEREIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0073 AND FALLETH NOT UNDER THE PRESENT QUESTION WHICH IS ONLY OF BODIES SUBORDINATE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0074 NO MEMBER THEREFORE IS OBLIGED TO PAY THE DEBT SO BORROWED BUT THE REPRESENTATIVE HIMSELF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0075 BECAUSE HE THAT LENDETH IT BEING A STRANGER TO THE LETTERS AND TO THE QUALIFICATION OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0076 UNDERSTANDETH THOSE ONLY FOR HIS DEBTORS THAT ARE ENGAGED AND SEEING THE REPRESENTER CAN ENGAGE HIMSELF AND NONE ELSE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0077 HAS HIM ONLY FOR DEBTOR WHO MUST THEREFORE PAY HIM OUT OF THE COMMON STOCK IF THERE BE ANY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0078 OR IF THERE BE NONE OUT OF HIS OWN ESTATE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0079 IF HE COME INTO DEBT BY CONTRACT OR MULCT THE CASE IS THE SAME
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0080 BUT WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVE IS AN ASSEMBLY AND THE DEBT TO A STRANGER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0081 ALL THEY AND ONLY THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEBT THAT GAVE THEIR VOTES TO THE BORROWING OF IT OR TO THE CONTRACT THAT MADE IT DUE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0082 OR TO THE FACT FOR WHICH THE MULCT WAS IMPOSED BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF THOSE IN VOTING
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0083 DID ENGAGE HIMSELF FOR THE PAYMENT FOR HE THAT IS AUTHOR OF THE BORROWING
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0084 IS OBLIGED TO THE PAYMENT EVEN OF THE WHOLE DEBT THOUGH WHEN PAID BY ANY ONE HE BE DISCHARGED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0085 BUT IF THE DEBT BE TO ONE OF THE ASSEMBLY THE ASSEMBLY ONLY IS OBLIGED TO THE PAYMENT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0086 OUT OF THEIR COMMON STOCK IF THEY HAVE ANY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0087 FOR HAVING LIBERTY OF VOTE IF HE VOTE THE MONEY SHALL BE BORROWED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0088 HE VOTES IT SHALL BE PAID IF HE VOTE IT SHALL NOT BE BORROWED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0089 OR BE ABSENT YET BECAUSE IN LENDING HE VOTETH THE BORROWING HE CONTRADICTETH HIS FORMER VOTE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0090 AND IS OBLIGED BY THE LATER AND BECOMES BOTH BORROWER AND LENDER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0091 AND CONSEQUENTLY CANNOT DEMAND PAYMENT FROM ANY PARTICULAR MAN BUT FROM THE COMMON TREASURE ONLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0092 WHICH FAILING HE HATH NO REMEDY NOR COMPLAINT BUT AGAINST HIMSELF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0093 THAT BEING PRIVY TO THE ACTS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THEIR MEANS TO PAY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0094 AND NOT BEING ENFORCED DID NEVERTHELESS THROUGH HIS OWN FOLLY LEND HIS MONEY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0095 IT IS MANIFEST BY THIS THAT IN BODIES POLITIC SUBORDINATE AND SUBJECT TO A SOVEREIGN POWER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0096 IT IS SOMETIMES NOT ONLY LAWFUL BUT EXPEDIENT FOR A PARTICULAR MAN TO MAKE OPEN PROTESTATION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0097 AGAINST THE DECREES OF THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY AND CAUSE THEIR DISSENT TO BE REGISTERED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0098 OR TO TAKE WITNESS OF IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY MAY BE OBLIGED TO PAY DEBTS CONTRACTED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0099 AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES COMMITTED BY OTHER MEN BUT IN A SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLY THAT LIBERTY IS TAKEN AWAY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0100 BOTH BECAUSE HE THAT PROTESTETH THERE DENIES THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND ALSO BECAUSE WHATSOEVER IS COMMANDED BY THE SOVEREIGN POWER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0101 IS AS TO THE SUBJECT THOUGH NOT SO ALWAYS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0102 JUSTIFIED BY THE COMMAND FOR OF SUCH COMMAND EVERY SUBJECT IS THE AUTHOR
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0103 THE VARIETY OF BODIES POLITIC IS ALMOST INFINITE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0104 FOR THEY ARE NOT ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE SEVERAL AFFAIRS FOR WHICH THEY ARE CONSTITUTED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0105 WHEREIN THERE IS AN UNSPEAKABLE DIVERSITY BUT ALSO BY THE TIMES PLACES AND NUMBERS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0106 SUBJECT TO MANY LIMITATIONS AND AS TO THEIR AFFAIRS SOME ARE ORDAINED FOR GOVERNMENT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0107 AS FIRST THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE MAY BE COMMITTED TO AN ASSEMBLY OF MEN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0108 WHEREIN ALL RESOLUTIONS SHALL DEPEND ON THE VOTES OF THE MAJOR PART
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0109 AND THEN THIS ASSEMBLY IS A BODY POLITIC AND THEIR POWER LIMITED BY COMMISSION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0110 THIS WORD PROVINCE SIGNIFIES A CHARGE OR CARE OF BUSINESS WHICH HE WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0111 COMMITTETH TO ANOTHER MAN TO BE ADMINISTERED FOR AND UNDER HIM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0112 AND THEREFORE WHEN IN ONE COMMON WEALTH THERE BE DIVERS COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THEIR LAWS DISTINCT ONE FROM ANOTHER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0113 OR ARE FAR DISTANT IN PLACE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT BEING COMMITTED TO DIVERS PERSONS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0114 THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE THE SOVEREIGN IS NOT RESIDENT BUT GOVERNS BY COMMISSION ARE CALLED PROVINCES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0115 BUT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE BY AN ASSEMBLY RESIDING IN THE PROVINCE IT SELF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0116 THERE BE FEW EXAMPLES THE ROMANS WHO HAD THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MANY PROVINCES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0117 YET GOVERNED THEM ALWAYS BY PRESIDENTS AND PRAETORS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0118 AND NOT BY ASSEMBLIES AS THEY GOVERNED THE CITY OF ROME AND TERRITORIES ADJACENT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0119 IN LIKE MANNER WHEN THERE WERE COLONIES SENT FROM ENGLAND TO PLANT VIRGINIA AND SOMMER ISLANDS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0120 THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF THEM HERE WERE COMMITTED TO ASSEMBLIES IN LONDON
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0121 YET DID THOSE ASSEMBLIES NEVER COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THEM TO ANY ASSEMBLY THERE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0122 BUT DID TO EACH PLANTATION SEND ONE GOVERNOR FOR THOUGH EVERY MAN WHERE HE CAN BE PRESENT BY NATURE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0123 DESIRES TO PARTICIPATE OF GOVERNMENT YET WHERE THEY CANNOT BE PRESENT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0124 THEY ARE BY NATURE ALSO INCLINED TO COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR COMMON INTEREST RATHER TO A MONARCHICAL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0125 THEN A POPULAR FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALSO EVIDENT IN THOSE MEN THAT HAVE GREAT PRIVATE ESTATES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0126 WHO WHEN THEY ARE UNWILLING TO TAKE THE PAINS OF ADMINISTERING THE BUSINESS THAT BELONGS TO THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0127 CHOOSE RATHER TO TRUST ONE SERVANT THAN A ASSEMBLY EITHER OF THEIR FRIENDS OR SERVANTS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0128 BUT HOWSOEVER IT BE IN FACT YET WE MAY SUPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE OR COLONY COMMITTED TO AN ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0129 AND WHEN IT IS THAT WHICH IN THIS PLACE I HAVE TO SAY IS THIS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0130 THAT WHATSOEVER DEBT IS BY THAT ASSEMBLY CONTRACTED OR WHATSOEVER UNLAWFUL ACT IS DECREED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0131 IS THE ACT ONLY OF THOSE THAT ASSENTED AND NOT OF ANY THAT DISSENTED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0132 OR WERE ABSENT FOR THE REASONS BEFORE ALLEGED ALSO THAT AN ASSEMBLY RESIDING OUT OF THE BOUNDS OF THAT COLONY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0133 WHEREOF THEY HAVE THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT EXECUTE ANY POWER OVER THE PERSONS OR GOODS OF ANY OF THE COLONY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0134 TO SEIZE ON THEM FOR DEBT OR OTHER DUTY IN ANY PLACE WITHOUT THE COLONY IT SELF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0135 AS HAVING NO JURISDICTION NOR AUTHORITY ELSEWHERE BUT ARE LEFT TO THE REMEDY WHICH THE LAW OF THE PLACE ALLOWETH THEM AND
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0136 THOUGH THE ASSEMBLY HAVE RIGHT TO IMPOSE A MULCT UPON ANY OF THEIR MEMBERS THAT SHALL BREAK THE LAWS THEY MAKE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0137 YET OUT OF THE COLONY IT SELF THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXECUTE THE SAME
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0138 AND THAT WHICH IS SAID HERE OF THE RIGHTS OF AN ASSEMBLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0139 OR A COLONY IS APPLICABLE ALSO TO AN ASSEMBLY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF A TOWN OR
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0140 UNIVERSITY OR A COLLEGE OR A CHURCH OR FOR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT OVER THE PERSONS OF MEN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0141 AND GENERALLY IN ALL BODIES POLITIC IF ANY PARTICULAR MEMBER CONCEIVE HIMSELF INJURED BY THE BODY IT SELF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0142 THE COGNISANCE OF HIS CAUSE BELONGED TO THE SOVEREIGN AND THOSE THE SOVEREIGN HATH ORDAINED FOR JUDGES IN SUCH CAUSES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0143 OR SHALL ORDAIN FOR THAT PARTICULAR CAUSE AND NOT TO THE BODY IT SELF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0144 FOR THE WHOLE BODY IS IN THIS CASE HIS FELLOW SUBJECT WHICH IN A SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLY IS OTHERWISE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0145 FOR THERE IF THE SOVEREIGN BE NOT JUDGE THOUGH IN HIS OWN CAUSE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0146 THERE CAN BE NO JUDGE AT ALL IN A BODY POLITIC FOR THE WELL ORDERING OF FOREIGN TRAFFIC
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0147 THE MOST COMMODIOUS REPRESENTATIVE IS AN ASSEMBLY OF ALL THE MEMBERS THAT IS TO SAY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0148 SUCH A ONE AS EVERY ONE THAT ADVENTURETH HIS MONEY MAY BE PRESENT AT ALL THE DELIBERATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0149 IF THEY WILL THEMSELVES FOR PROOF WHEREOF WE ARE TO CONSIDER THE END FOR WHICH MEN THAT ARE MERCHANTS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0150 AND MAY BUY AND SELL EXPORT AND IMPORT THEIR MERCHANDISE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN DISCRETIONS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0151 DOE NEVERTHELESS BIND THEMSELVES UP IN ONE CORPORATION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0152 IT IS TRUE THERE BE FEW MERCHANTS THAT WITH THE MERCHANDISE THEY BUY AT HOME
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0153 CAN FREIGHT A SHIP TO EXPORT IT OR WITH THAT THEY BUY ABROAD TO BRING IT HOME
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0154 AND HAVE THEREFORE NEED TO JOIN TOGETHER IN ONE SOCIETY WHERE EVERY MAN MAY EITHER PARTICIPATE OF THE GAIN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0155 ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF HIS ADVENTURE OR TAKE HIS OWN AND SELL WHAT HE TRANSPORTS OR IMPORTS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0156 AT SUCH PRICES AS HE THINKS FIT BUT THIS IS NO BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0157 THERE BEING NO COMMON REPRESENTATIVE TO OBLIGE THEM TO ANY OTHER LAW THAN THAT WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL OTHER SUBJECTS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0158 THE END OF THEIR INCORPORATING IS TO MAKE THEIR GAIN THE GREATER WHICH IS DONE TWO WAYS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0159 BY SOLE BUYING AND SOLE SELLING BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0160 SO THAT TO GRANT TO A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS TO BE A CORPORATION OR BODY POLITIC
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0161 IS TO GRANT THEM A DOUBLE MONOPOLY WHEREOF ONE IS TO BE SOLE BUYERS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0162 ANOTHER TO BE SOLE SELLERS FOR WHEN THERE IS A COMPANY INCORPORATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0163 THEY ONLY EXPORT THE COMMODITIES VENDIBLE IN THAT COUNTRY WHICH IS SOLE BUYING AT HOME AND SOLE SELLING ABROAD
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0164 FOR AT HOME THERE IS BUT ONE BUYER AND ABROAD BUT ONE THAT SELLETH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0165 BOTH WHICH IS GAINFUL TO THE MERCHANT BECAUSE THEREBY THEY BUY AT HOME AT LOWER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0166 AND SELL ABROAD AT HIGHER RATES AND ABROAD THERE IS BUT ONE BUYER OF FOREIGN MERCHANDISE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0167 AND BUT ONE THAT SELLS THEM AT HOME BOTH WHICH AGAIN ARE GAINFUL TO THE ADVENTURERS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0168 OF THIS DOUBLE MONOPOLY ONE PART IS DISADVANTAGEOUS TO THE PEOPLE AT HOME THE OTHER TO FOREIGNERS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0169 FOR AT HOME BY THEIR SOLE EXPORTATION THEY SET WHAT PRICE THEY PLEASE ON THE HUSBANDRY AND HANDY WORKS OF THE PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0170 AND BY THE SOLE IMPORTATION WHAT PRICE THEY PLEASE ON ALL FOREIGN COMMODITIES THE PEOPLE HAVE NEED OF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0171 BOTH WHICH ARE ILL FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE CONTRARY BY THE SOLE SELLING OF THE NATIVE COMMODITIES ABROAD
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0172 AND SOLE BUYING THE FOREIGN COMMODITIES UPON THE PLACE THEY RAISE THE PRICE OF THOSE AND ABATE THE PRICE OF THESE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0173 TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE FOREIGNER FOR WHERE BUT ONE SELLETH THE MERCHANDISE IS THE DEARER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0174 AND WHERE BUT ONE BUYETH THE CHEAPER SUCH CORPORATIONS THEREFORE ARE NO OTHER THEN MONOPOLIES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0175 THOUGH THEY WOULD BE VERY PROFITABLE FOR A COMMON WEALTH IF BEING BOUND UP INTO ONE BODY IN FOREIGN MARKETS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0176 THEY WERE AT LIBERTY AT HOME EVERY MAN TO BUY AND SELL AT WHAT PRICE HE COULD
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0177 THE END THEN OF THESE BODIES OF MERCHANTS BEING NOT A COMMON BENEFIT TO THE WHOLE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0178 WHICH HAVE IN THIS CASE NO COMMON STOCK BUT WHAT IS DEDUCTED OUT OF THE PARTICULAR ADVENTURES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0179 FOR BUILDING BUYING VICTUALLING AND MANNING OF SHIPS BUT THE PARTICULAR GAIN OF EVERY ADVENTURER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0180 IT IS REASON THAT EVERY ONE BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OF HIS OWN THAT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0181 IS THAT EVERY ONE BE OF THE ASSEMBLY THAT SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO ORDER THE SAME
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0182 AND BE ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR ACCOUNTS AND THEREFORE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF SUCH A BODY MUST BE AN ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0183 WHERE EVERY MEMBER OF THE BODY MAY BE PRESENT AT THE CONSULTATIONS IF HE WILL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0184 IF A BODY POLITIC OF MERCHANTS CONTRACT A DEBT TO A STRANGER BY THE ACT OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0185 EVERY MEMBER IS LIABLE BY HIMSELF FOR THE WHOLE FOR A STRANGER CAN TAKE NO NOTICE OF THEIR PRIVATE LAWS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0186 BUT CONSIDERETH THEM AS SO MANY PARTICULAR MEN OBLIGED EVERY ONE TO THE WHOLE PAYMENT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0187 TILL PAYMENT MADE BY ONE DISCHARGETH ALL THE REST BUT IF THE DEBT BE TO ONE OF THE COMPANY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0188 THE CREDITOR IS DEBTER FOR THE WHOLE TO HIMSELF
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0189 AND CANNOT THEREFORE DEMAND HIS DEBT BUT ONLY FROM THE COMMON STOCK IF THERE BE ANY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0190 IF THE COMMON WEALTH IMPOSE A TAX UPON THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0191 IT IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE LAID UPON EVERY MEMBER PROPORTIONALLY TO HIS PARTICULAR ADVENTURE IN THE COMPANY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0192 FOR THERE IS IN THIS CASE NO OTHER COMMON STOCK BUT WHAT IS MADE OF THEIR PARTICULAR ADVENTURES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0193 IF A MULCT BE LAID UPON THE BODY FOR SOME UNLAWFUL ACT THEY ONLY ARE LIABLE BY WHOSE VOTES THE ACT WAS DECREED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0194 OR BY WHOSE ASSISTANCE IT WAS EXECUTED FOR IN NONE OF THE REST IS THERE ANY OTHER CRIME BUT BEING OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0195 WHICH IF A CRIME BECAUSE THE BODY WAS ORDAINED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0196 IS NOT HIS IF ONE OF THE MEMBERS BE INDEBTED TO THE BODY HE MAY BE SUED BY THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0197 BUT HIS GOODS CANNOT BE TAKEN NOR HIS PERSON IMPRISONED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0198 BUT ONLY BY AUTHORITY OF THE COMMON WEALTH FOR IF THEY CAN DOE IT BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0199 THEY CAN BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY GIVE JUDGMENT THAT THE DEBT IS DUE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0200 WHICH IS AS MUCH AS TO BE JUDGE IN THEIR OWN CAUSE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0201 THESE BODIES MADE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF MEN OR OF TRAFFIC BE EITHER PERPETUAL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0202 OR FOR A TIME PRESCRIBED BY WRITING BUT THERE BE BODIES ALSO WHOSE TIMES ARE LIMITED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0203 AND THAT ONLY BY THE NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE IF A SOVEREIGN MONARCH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0204 OR A SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLY SHALL THINK FIT TO GIVE COMMAND TO THE TOWNS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0205 AND OTHER SEVERAL PARTS OF THEIR TERRITORY TO SEND TO HIM THEIR DEPUTIES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0206 TO INFORM HIM OF THE CONDITION AND NECESSITIES OF THE SUBJECTS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0207 OR TO ADVISE WITH HIM FOR THE MAKING OF GOOD LAWS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0208 OR FOR ANY OTHER CAUSE AS WITH ONE PERSON REPRESENTING THE WHOLE COUNTRY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0209 SUCH DEPUTIES HAVING A PLACE AND TIME OF MEETING ASSIGNED THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0210 ARE THERE AND AT THAT TIME A BODY POLITIC REPRESENTING EVERY SUBJECT OF THAT DOMINION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0211 BUT IT IS ONLY FOR SUCH MATTERS AS SHALL BE PROPOUNDED UNTO THEM BY THAT MAN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0212 OR ASSEMBLY THAT BY THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY SENT FOR THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0213 AND WHEN IT SHALL BE DECLARED THAT NOTHING MORE SHALL BE PROPOUNDED NOR DEBATED BY THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0214 THE BODY IS DISSOLVED FOR IF THEY WERE THE ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0215 THEN WERE IT THE SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLY AND SO THERE WOULD BE TWO SOVEREIGN ASSEMBLIES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0216 OR TWO SOVEREIGNS OVER THE SAME PEOPLE WHICH CANNOT CONSIST WITH THEIR PEACE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0217 AND THEREFORE WHERE THERE IS ONCE A SOVEREIGNTY THERE CAN BE NO ABSOLUTE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE BUT BY IT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0218 AND FOR THE LIMITS OF HOW FAR SUCH A BODY SHALL REPRESENT THE WHOLE PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0219 THEY ARE SET FORTH IN THE WRITING BY WHICH THEY WERE SENT FOR
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0220 FOR THE PEOPLE CANNOT CHOOSE THEIR DEPUTIES TO OTHER INTENT THAN IS IN THE WRITING DIRECTED TO THEM FROM THEIR SOVEREIGN EXPRESSED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0221 PRIVATE BODIES REGULAR AND LAWFUL ARE THOSE THAT ARE CONSTITUTED WITHOUT LETTERS OR OTHER WRITTEN AUTHORITY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0222 SAVING THE LAWS COMMON TO ALL OTHER SUBJECTS AND BECAUSE THEY BE UNITED IN ONE PERSON REPRESENTATIVE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0223 THEY ARE HELD FOR REGULAR SUCH AS ARE ALL FAMILIES IN WHICH THE FATHER OR MASTER ORDERETH THE WHOLE FAMILY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0224 FOR HE OBLIGETH HIS CHILDREN AND SERVANTS AS FAR AS THE LAW PERMITTETH THOUGH NOT FURTHER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0225 BECAUSE NONE OF THEM ARE BOUND TO OBEDIENCE IN THOSE ACTIONS WHICH THE LAW HATH FORBIDDEN TO BE DONE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0226 IN ALL OTHER ACTIONS DURING THE TIME THEY ARE UNDER DOMESTIC GOVERNMENT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR FATHERS AND MASTERS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0227 AS TO THEIR IMMEDIATE SOVEREIGNS FOR THE FATHER AND MASTER BEING BEFORE THE INSTITUTION OF COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0228 ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNS IN THEIR OWN FAMILIES THEY LOSE AFTERWARD NO MORE OF THEIR AUTHORITY THAN THE LAW OF THE COMMON WEALTH TAKETH FROM THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0229 PRIVATE BODIES REGULAR BUT UNLAWFUL ARE THOSE THAT UNITE THEMSELVES INTO ONE PERSON REPRESENTATIVE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0230 WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC AUTHORITY AT ALL SUCH AS ARE THE CORPORATIONS OF BEGGARS THIEVES AND GYPSIES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0231 THE BETTER TO ORDER THEIR TRADE OF BEGGING AND STEALING AND
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0232 THE CORPORATIONS OF MEN THAT BY AUTHORITY FROM ANY FOREIGN PERSON UNITE THEMSELVES IN ANOTHERS DOMINION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0233 FOR EASIER PROPAGATION OF DOCTRINES AND FOR MAKING A PARTY AGAINST THE POWER OF THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0234 IRREGULAR SYSTEMS IN THEIR NATURE BUT LEAGUES OR SOMETIMES MEER CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT UNION TO ANY PARTICULAR DESIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0235 NOT BY OBLIGATION OF ONE TO ANOTHER BUT PROCEEDING ONLY FROM A SIMILITUDE OF WILLS AND INCLINATIONS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0236 BECOME LAWFUL OR UNLAWFUL ACCORDING TO THE LAWFULNESS OR UNLAWFULNESS OF EVERY PARTICULAR MANS DESIGN THEREIN AND
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0237 HIS DESIGN IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE OCCASION THE LEAGUES OF SUBJECTS BECAUSE LEAGUES ARE COMMONLY MADE FOR MUTUAL DEFENSE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0238 ARE IN A COMMON WEALTH WHICH IS NO MORE THAN A LEAGUE OF ALL THE SUBJECTS TOGETHER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0239 FOR THE MOST PART UNNECESSARY AND SAVOUR OF UNLAWFUL DESIGN AND ARE FOR THAT CAUSE UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0240 AND GO COMMONLY BY THE NAME OF FACTIONS OR CONSPIRACIES FOR A LEAGUE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0241 BEING A CONNEXION OF MEN BY COVENANTS IF THERE BE NO POWER GIVEN TO ANY ONE MAN OR ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0242 AS IN THE CONDITION OF MEER NATURE TO COMPEL THEM TO PERFORMANCE IS SO LONG ONLY VALID
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0243 AS THERE ARISETH NO JUST CAUSE OF DISTRUST AND THEREFORE LEAGUES BETWEEN COMMON WEALTHS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0244 OVER WHOM THERE IS NO HUMANE POWER ESTABLISHED TO KEEP THEM ALL IN AWE ARE NOT ONLY LAWFUL BUT ALSO PROFITABLE FOR THE TIME THEY LAST
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0245 BUT LEAGUES OF THE SUBJECTS OF ONE AND THE SAME COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0246 WHERE EVERY ONE MAY OBTAIN HIS RIGHT BY MEANS OF THE SOVEREIGN POWER
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0247 ARE UNNECESSARY TO THE MAINTAINING OF PEACE AND JUSTICE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0248 AND IN CASE THE DESIGN OF THEM BE EVIL OR UNKNOWN TO THE COMMON WEALTH
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0249 UNLAWFUL FOR ALL UNITING OF STRENGTH BY PRIVATE MEN IS IF FOR EVIL INTENT UNJUST
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0250 IF FOR INTENT UNKNOWN DANGEROUS TO THE PUBLIC AND UNJUSTLY CONCEALED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0251 IF THE SOVEREIGN POWER BE IN A GREAT ASSEMBLY AND A NUMBER OF MEN PART OF THE ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0252 WITHOUT AUTHORITY CONSULT A PART TO CONTRIVE THE GUIDANCE OF THE REST
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0253 THIS IS A FACTION OR CONSPIRACY UNLAWFUL AS BEING A FRAUDULENT SEDUCING OF THE ASSEMBLY FOR THEIR PARTICULAR INTEREST
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0254 BUT IF HE WHOSE PRIVATE INTEREST IS TO BE DEBATED AND JUDGED IN THE ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0255 MAKE AS MANY FRIENDS AS HE CAN IN HIM IT IS NO INJUSTICE BECAUSE IN THIS CASE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0256 HE IS NO PART OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THOUGH HE HIRE SUCH FRIENDS WITH MONEY UNLESS THERE BE AN EXPRESS LAW AGAINST IT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0257 YET IT IS NOT INJUSTICE FOR SOMETIMES AS MENS MANNERS ARE JUSTICE CANNOT BE HAD WITHOUT MONEY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0258 AND EVERY MAN MAY THINK HIS OWN CAUSE JUST TILL IT BE HEARD AND JUDGED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0259 IN ALL COMMON WEALTHS IF A PRIVATE MAN ENTERTAIN MORE SERVANTS THAN THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS ESTATE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0260 AND LAWFUL EMPLOYMENT HE HAS FOR THEM REQUIRES IT IS FACTION AND UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0261 FOR HAVING THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMON WEALTH HE NEEDETH NOT THE DEFENSE OF PRIVATE FORCE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0262 AND WHEREAS IN NATIONS NOT THOROUGHLY CIVILIZED SEVERAL NUMEROUS FAMILIES HAVE LIVED IN CONTINUAL HOSTILITY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0263 AND INVADED ONE ANOTHER WITH PRIVATE FORCE YET IT IS EVIDENT ENOUGH THAT THEY HAVE DONE UNJUSTLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0264 OR ELSE THAT THEY HAD NO COMMON WEALTH AND AS FACTIONS FOR KINDRED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0265 SO ALSO FACTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT OF RELIGION AS OF PAPISTS PROTESTANTS ETCETERA
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0266 OR OF STATE AS PATRICIANS AND PLEBEIANS OF OLD TIME IN ROME
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0267 AND OF ARISTOCRATICALS AND DEMOCRATICALS OF OLD TIME IN GREECE ARE UNJUST
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0268 AS BEING CONTRARY TO THE PEACE AND SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0269 AND A TAKING OF THE SWORD OUT OF THE HAND OF THE SOVEREIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0270 CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE IS AN IRREGULAR SYSTEM THE LAWFULNESS OR UNLAWFULNESS WHEREOF DEPENDETH ON THE OCCASION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0271 AND ON THE NUMBER OF THEM THAT ARE ASSEMBLED IF THE OCCASION BE LAWFUL AND MANIFEST
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0272 THE CONCOURSE IS LAWFUL AS THE USUAL MEETING OF MEN AT CHURCH OR AT A PUBLIC SHEW
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0273 IN USUAL NUMBERS FOR IF THE NUMBERS BE EXTRAORDINARILY GREAT THE OCCASION IS NOT EVIDENT AND CONSEQUENTLY HE THAT CANNOT RENDER A PARTICULAR AND GOOD ACCOUNT
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0274 OF HIS BEING AMONGST THEM IS TO BE JUDGED CONSCIOUS OF AN UNLAWFUL AND TUMULTUOUS DESIGN
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0275 IT MAY BE LAWFUL FOR A THOUSAND MEN TO JOIN IN A PETITION TO BE DELIVERED TO A JUDGE OR MAGISTRATE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0276 YET IF A THOUSAND MEN COME TO PRESENT IT IT IS A TUMULTUOUS ASSEMBLY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0277 BECAUSE THERE NEEDS BUT ONE OR TWO FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT IN SUCH CASES AS THESE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0278 IT IS NOT A SET NUMBER THAT MAKES THE ASSEMBLY UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0279 BUT SUCH A NUMBER AS THE PRESENT OFFICERS ARE NOT ABLE TO SUPPRESS AND BRING TO JUSTICE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0280 WHEN AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF MEN ASSEMBLE AGAINST A MAN WHOM THEY ACCUSE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0281 THE ASSEMBLY IS AN UNLAWFUL TUMULT BECAUSE THEY MAY DELIVER THEIR ACCUSATION TO THE MAGISTRATE BY A FEW
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0282 OR BY ONE MAN SUCH WAS THE CASE OF ST PAUL AT EPHESUS
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0283 WHERE DEMETRIUS AND A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER MEN BROUGHT TWO OF PAULS COMPANIONS BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0284 SAYING WITH ONE VOYCE QUOTE GREAT IS DIANA OF THE EPHESIANS UNQUOTE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0285 WHICH WAS THEIR WAY OF DEMANDING JUSTICE AGAINST THEM
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0286 FOR TEACHING THE PEOPLE SUCH DOCTRINE AS WAS AGAINST THEIR RELIGION AND TRADE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0287 THE OCCASION HERE CONSIDERING THE LAWS OF THAT PEOPLE WAS JUST YET WAS THEIR ASSEMBLY JUDGED UNLAWFUL
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0288 AND THE MAGISTRATE REPREHENDED THEM FOR IT IN THESE WORDS QUOTE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0289 IF DEMETRIUS AND THE OTHER WORK MEN CAN ACCUSE ANY MAN OF ANY THING
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0290 THERE BE PLEAS AND DEPUTIES LET THEM ACCUSE ONE ANOTHER AND IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THING TO DEMAND
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0291 YOUR CASE MAY BE JUDGED IN AN ASSEMBLY LAWFULLY CALLED
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0292 FOR WE ARE IN DANGER TO BE ACCUSED FOR THIS DAYS SEDITION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0293 BECAUSE THERE IS NO CAUSE BY WHICH ANY MAN CAN RENDER ANY REASON OF THIS CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0294 UNQUOTE WHERE HE CALLETH AN ASSEMBLY WHEREOF MEN CAN GIVE NO JUST ACCOUNT A SEDITION
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0295 AND SUCH AS THEY COULD NOT ANSWER FOR AND THIS IS ALL I SHALL SAY CONCERNING SYSTEMS AND ASSEMBLIES OF PEOPLE
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0296 WHICH MAY BE COMPARED AS I SAID TO THE SIMILAR PARTS OF MANS BODY
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0297 SUCH AS BE LAWFUL TO THE MUSCLES SUCH AS ARE UNLAWFUL TO WENS BILES AND APOSTEMES
leonMire-20080526-lev-lev0298 ENGENDERED BY THE UNNATURAL CONFLUX OF EVIL HUMOURS END OF CHAPTER TWENTY TWO

letsdothis-20080428-tfe-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
letsdothis-20080428-tfe-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
letsdothis-20080428-tfe-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
letsdothis-20080428-tfe-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
letsdothis-20080428-tfe-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
letsdothis-20080428-tfe-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
letsdothis-20080428-tfe-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
letsdothis-20080428-tfe-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING

librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0078 DELIBERATE WHETHER TO BUY HIM A COAT WHICH HE SADLY NEEDED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0079 OR INVEST HIS MONEY IN A PEDESTRIAN TRIP TO ROCKAWAY BEACH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0080 WHY IS ALMOST EVERY ROBUST HEALTHY BOY WITH A ROBUST HEALTHY SOUL IN HIM
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0081 AT SOME TIME OR OTHER CRAZY TO GO TO SEA
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0082 WHY UPON YOUR FIRST VOYAGE AS A PASSENGER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0083 DID YOU YOURSELF FEEL SUCH A MYSTICAL VIBRATION
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0084 WHEN FIRST TOLD THAT YOU AND YOUR SHIP
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0085 WERE NOW OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0086 WHY DID THE OLD PERSIANS HOLD THE SEA HOLY

librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0088 AND OWN BROTHER OF JOVE SURELY ALL THIS IS NOT WITHOUT MEANING
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0089 AND STILL DEEPER THE MEANING OF THAT STORY OF NARCISSUS WHO BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GRASP THE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0090 TORMENTING MILD IMAGE HE SAW IN THE FOUNTAIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0091 PLUNGED INTO IT AND WAS DROWNED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0092 BUT THAT SAME IMAGE WE OURSELVES SEE IN ALL RIVERS AND OCEANS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0093 IT IS THE IMAGE OF THE UNGRASPABLE PHANTOM OF LIFE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0094 AND THIS IS THE KEY TO IT ALL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0095 NOW WHEN I SAY THAT I AM IN THE HABIT OF GOING TO SEA WHENEVER I BEGIN TO GROW HAZY ABOUT THE EYES AND BEGIN TO BE OVER CONSCIOUS OF MY LUNGS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0096 I DO NOT MEAN TO HAVE IT INFERRED THAT I EVER GO TO SEA AS A PASSENGER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0097 FOR TO GO AS A PASSENGER YOU MUST NEEDS HAVE A PURSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0098 AND A PURSE IS BUT A RAG UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN IT

librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0116 AT FIRST THIS SORT OF THING IS UNPLEASANT ENOUGH IT TOUCHES ONE'S SENSE OF HONOUR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0117 PARTICULARLY IF YOU COME OF AN OLD ESTABLISHED FAMILY IN THE LAND THE VAN RENSSELAERS OR RANDOLPHS OR HARDICANUTES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0118 AND MORE THAN ALL IF JUST PREVIOUS TO PUTTING YOUR HAND INTO THE TAR POT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0119 YOU HAVE BEEN LORDING IT AS A COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0120 MAKING THE TALLEST BOYS STAND IN AWE OF YOU
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0121 THE TRANSITION IS A KEEN ONE I ASSURE YOU FROM A SCHOOLMASTER TO A SAILOR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0122 AND REQUIRES A STRONG DECOCTION OF SENECA AND THE STOICS TO ENABLE YOU TO GRIN AND BEAR IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0123 BUT EVEN THIS WEARS OFF IN TIME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0124 WHAT OF IT IF SOME OLD HUNKS OF A SEA CAPTAIN ORDERS ME TO GET A BROOM AND SWEEP DOWN THE DECKS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0125 WHAT DOES THAT INDIGNITY AMOUNT TO WEIGHED I MEAN IN THE SCALES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0126 DO YOU THINK THE ARCHANGEL GABRIEL THINKS ANYTHING THE LESS OF ME BECAUSE I PROMPTLY AND RESPECTFULLY OBEY THAT OLD HUNKS IN THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0127 WHO AIN'T A SLAVE TELL ME THAT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0128 WELL THEN HOWEVER THE OLD SEA CAPTAINS MAY ORDER ME ABOUT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0129 HOWEVER THEY MAY THUMP AND PUNCH ME ABOUT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0130 I HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT IT IS ALL RIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0131 THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS ONE WAY OR OTHER SERVED IN MUCH THE SAME WAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0132 EITHER IN A PHYSICAL OR METAPHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW THAT IS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0133 AND SO THE UNIVERSAL THUMP IS PASSED ROUND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0134 AND ALL HANDS SHOULD RUB EACH OTHER'S SHOULDER BLADES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0135 AND BE CONTENT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0136 AGAIN I ALWAYS GO TO SEA AS A SAILOR BECAUSE THEY MAKE A POINT OF PAYING ME FOR MY TROUBLE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0137 WHEREAS THEY NEVER PAY PASSENGERS A SINGLE PENNY THAT I EVER HEARD OF ON THE CONTRARY PASSENGERS THEMSELVES MUST PAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0138 AND THERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD BETWEEN PAYING AND BEING PAID
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0139 THE ACT OF PAYING IS PERHAPS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE INFLICTION THAT THE TWO ORCHARD THIEVES ENTAILED UPON US
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0140 BUT BEING PAID WHAT WILL COMPARE WITH IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0141 THE URBANE ACTIVITY WITH WHICH A MAN RECEIVES MONEY IS REALLY MARVELLOUS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0142 CONSIDERING THAT WE SO EARNESTLY BELIEVE MONEY TO BE THE ROOT OF ALL EARTHLY ILLS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0143 AND THAT ON NO ACCOUNT CAN A MONIED MAN ENTER HEAVEN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0144 AH HOW CHEERFULLY WE CONSIGN OURSELVES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0145 TO PERDITION FINALLY I ALWAYS GO TO SEA AS A SAILOR BECAUSE OF THE WHOLESOME EXERCISE AND PURE AIR OF THE FORE CASTLE DECK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0146 FOR AS IN THIS WORLD HEAD WINDS ARE FAR MORE PREVALENT THAN WINDS FROM ASTERN THAT IS IF YOU NEVER VIOLATE THE PYTHAGOREAN MAXIM
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0147 SO FOR THE MOST PART THE COMMODORE ON THE QUARTER DECK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0148 GETS HIS ATMOSPHERE AT SECOND HAND FROM THE SAILORS ON THE FORECASTLE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0149 HE THINKS HE BREATHES IT FIRST BUT NOT SO
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0150 IN MUCH THE SAME WAY DO THE COMMONALTY LEAD THEIR LEADERS IN MANY OTHER THINGS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0151 AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE LEADERS LITTLE SUSPECT IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0152 BUT WHEREFORE IT WAS THAT AFTER HAVING REPEATEDLY SMELT THE SEA AS A MERCHANT SAILOR I SHOULD NOW TAKE IT INTO MY HEAD TO GO ON A WHALING VOYAGE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0153 THIS THE INVISIBLE POLICE OFFICER OF THE FATES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0154 WHO HAS THE CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE OF ME AND SECRETLY DOGS ME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0155 AND INFLUENCES ME IN SOME UNACCOUNTABLE WAY HE CAN BETTER ANSWER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0156 THAN ANY ONE ELSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0157 AND DOUBTLESS MY GOING ON THIS WHALING VOYAGE FORMED PART OF THE GRAND PROGRAMME OF PROVIDENCE THAT WAS DRAWN UP A LONG TIME AGO
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0158 IT CAME IN AS A SORT OF BRIEF INTERLUDE AND SOLO
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0159 BETWEEN MORE EXTENSIVE PERFORMANCES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0160 I TAKE IT THAT THIS PART OF THE BILL MUST HAVE RUN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0161 GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0162 WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL BLOODY BATTLE IN AFGHANISTAN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0163 THOUGH I CANNOT TELL WHY IT WAS EXACTLY THAT THOSE STAGE MANAGERS THE FATES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0164 PUT ME DOWN FOR THIS SHABBY PART OF A WHALING VOYAGE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0165 WHEN OTHERS WERE SET DOWN FOR MAGNIFICENT PARTS IN HIGH TRAGEDIES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0166 AND SHORT AND EASY PARTS IN GENTEEL COMEDIES AND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0167 JOLLY PARTS IN FARCES THOUGH I CANNOT TELL WHY THIS WAS EXACTLY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0168 YET NOW THAT I RECALL ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0169 I THINK I CAN SEE A LITTLE INTO THE SPRINGS AND MOTIVES WHICH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0170 BEING CUNNINGLY PRESENTED TO ME UNDER VARIOUS DISGUISES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0171 INDUCED ME TO SET ABOUT PERFORMING THE PART I DID
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0172 BESIDES CAJOLING ME INTO THE DELUSION THAT IT WAS A CHOICE RESULTING FROM MY OWN UNBIASED FREEWILL AND DISCRIMINATING JUDGMENT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0173 CHIEF AMONG THESE MOTIVES WAS THE OVERWHELMING IDEA OF THE GREAT WHALE HIMSELF
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0174 SUCH A PORTENTOUS AND MYSTERIOUS MONSTER ROUSED ALL MY CURIOSITY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0175 THEN THE WILD AND DISTANT SEAS WHERE HE ROLLED HIS ISLAND BULK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0176 THE UNDELIVERABLE NAMELESS PERILS OF THE WHALE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0177 THESE WITH ALL THE ATTENDING MARVELS OF A THOUSAND PATAGONIAN SIGHTS AND SOUNDS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0178 HELPED TO SWAY ME TO MY WISH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0179 WITH OTHER MEN PERHAPS SUCH THINGS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INDUCEMENTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0180 BUT AS FOR ME I AM TORMENTED WITH AN EVERLASTING ITCH FOR THINGS REMOTE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0181 I LOVE TO SAIL FORBIDDEN SEAS AND LAND ON BARBAROUS COASTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0182 NOT IGNORING WHAT IS GOOD I AM QUICK TO PERCEIVE A HORROR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0183 AND COULD STILL BE SOCIAL WITH IT WOULD THEY LET ME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0184 SINCE IT IS BUT WELL TO BE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH ALL THE INMATES OF THE PLACE ONE LODGES IN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0185 BY REASON OF THESE THINGS THEN THE WHALING VOYAGE WAS WELCOME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0186 THE GREAT FLOOD GATES OF THE WONDER WORLD SWUNG OPEN AND IN THE WILD CONCEITS THAT SWAYED ME TO MY PURPOSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0187 TWO AND TWO THERE FLOATED INTO MY INMOST SOUL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0188 ENDLESS PROCESSIONS OF THE WHALE AND MID MOST OF THEM ALL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0189 ONE GRAND HOODED PHANTOM LIKE A SNOW HILL IN THE AIR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0190 CHAPTER TWO THE CARPET BAG
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0191 I STUFFED A SHIRT OR TWO INTO MY OLD CARPET BAG TUCKED IT UNDER MY ARM AND STARTED FOR CAPE HORN AND THE PACIFIC
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0192 QUITTING THE GOOD CITY OF OLD MANHATTO I DULY ARRIVED IN NEW BEDFORD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0193 IT WAS A SATURDAY NIGHT IN DECEMBER MUCH WAS I DISAPPOINTED UPON LEARNING THAT THE LITTLE PACKET FOR NANTUCKET HAD ALREADY SAILED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0194 AND THAT NO WAY OF REACHING THAT PLACE WOULD OFFER TILL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0195 AS MOST YOUNG CANDIDATES FOR THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF WHALING STOP AT THIS SAME NEW BEDFORD THENCE TO EMBARK ON THEIR VOYAGE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0196 IT MAY AS WELL BE RELATED THAT I FOR ONE HAD NO IDEA OF SO DOING FOR MY MIND WAS MADE UP TO SAIL IN NO OTHER THAN A NANTUCKET CRAFT BECAUSE THERE WAS A FINE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0197 BOISTEROUS SOMETHING ABOUT EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH THAT FAMOUS OLD ISLAND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0198 WHICH AMAZINGLY PLEASED ME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0199 BESIDES THOUGH NEW BEDFORD HAS OF LATE BEEN GRADUALLY MONOPOLISING THE BUSINESS OF WHALING
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0200 AND THOUGH IN THIS MATTER POOR OLD NANTUCKET IS NOW MUCH BEHIND HER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0201 YET NANTUCKET WAS HER GREAT ORIGINAL THE TYRE OF THIS CARTHAGE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0202 THE PLACE WHERE THE FIRST DEAD AMERICAN WHALE WAS STRANDED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0203 WHERE ELSE BUT FROM NANTUCKET DID THOSE ABORIGINAL WHALEMEN THE RED MEN FIRST SALLY OUT IN CANOES TO GIVE CHASE TO THE LEVIATHAN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0204 AND WHERE BUT FROM NANTUCKET TOO DID THAT FIRST ADVENTUROUS LITTLE SLOOP PUT FORTH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0205 PARTLY LADEN WITH IMPORTED COBBLESTONES SO GOES THE STORY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0206 TO THROW AT THE WHALES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0207 IN ORDER TO DISCOVER WHEN THEY WERE NIGH ENOUGH TO RISK A HARPOON FROM THE BOWSPRIT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0208 NOW HAVING A NIGHT A DAY AND STILL ANOTHER NIGHT FOLLOWING BEFORE ME IN NEW BEDFORD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0209 ERE I COULD EMBARK FOR MY DESTINED PORT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0210 IT BECAME A MATTER OF CONCERNMENT WHERE I WAS TO EAT AND SLEEP MEANWHILE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0211 IT WAS A VERY DUBIOUS LOOKING NAY A VERY DARK AND DISMAL NIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0212 BITINGLY COLD AND CHEERLESS I KNEW NO ONE IN THE PLACE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0213 WITH ANXIOUS GRAPNELS I HAD SOUNDED MY POCKET AND ONLY BROUGHT UP A FEW PIECES OF SILVER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0214 SO WHEREVER YOU GO ISHMAEL SAID I TO MYSELF AS I STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A DREARY STREET SHOULDERING MY BAG
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0215 AND COMPARING THE GLOOM TOWARDS THE NORTH WITH THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE SOUTH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0216 WHEREVER IN YOUR WISDOM YOU MAY CONCLUDE TO LODGE FOR THE NIGHT MY DEAR ISHMAEL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0217 BE SURE TO INQUIRE THE PRICE AND DON'T BE TOO PARTICULAR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0218 WITH HALTING STEPS I PACED THE STREETS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0219 AND PASSED THE SIGN OF THE CROSSED HARPOONS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0220 BUT IT LOOKED TOO EXPENSIVE AND JOLLY THERE FURTHER ON FROM THE BRIGHT RED WINDOWS OF THE SWORD FISH INN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0221 THERE CAME SUCH FERVENT RAYS THAT IT SEEMED TO HAVE MELTED THE PACKED SNOW AND ICE FROM BEFORE THE HOUSE FOR EVERYWHERE ELSE THE CONGEALED FROST LAY TEN INCHES THICK
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0222 IN A HARD ASPHALTIC PAVEMENT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0223 RATHER WEARY FOR ME WHEN I STRUCK MY FOOT AGAINST THE FLINTY PROJECTIONS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0224 BECAUSE FROM HARD REMORSELESS SERVICE THE SOLES OF MY BOOTS WERE IN A MOST MISERABLE PLIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0225 TOO EXPENSIVE AND JOLLY AGAIN THOUGHT I
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0226 PAUSING ONE MOMENT TO WATCH THE BROAD GLARE IN THE STREET AND HEAR THE SOUNDS OF THE TINKLING GLASSES WITHIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0227 BUT GO ON ISHMAEL SAID I AT LAST DON'T YOU HEAR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0228 GET AWAY FROM BEFORE THE DOOR YOUR PATCHED BOOTS ARE STOPPING THE WAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0229 SO ON I WENT I NOW BY INSTINCT FOLLOWED THE STREETS THAT TOOK ME WATERWARD
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0230 FOR THERE DOUBTLESS WERE THE CHEAPEST IF NOT THE CHEERIEST INNS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0231 SUCH DREARY STREETS BLOCKS OF BLACKNESS NOT HOUSES ON EITHER HAND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0232 AND HERE AND THERE A CANDLE LIKE A CANDLE MOVING ABOUT IN A TOMB
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0233 AT THIS HOUR OF THE NIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0234 OF THE LAST DAY OF THE WEEK THAT QUARTER OF THE TOWN PROVED ALL BUT DESERTED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0235 BUT PRESENTLY I CAME TO A SMOKY LIGHT PROCEEDING FROM A LOW WIDE BUILDING
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0236 THE DOOR OF WHICH STOOD INVITINGLY OPEN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0237 IT HAD A CARELESS LOOK AS IF IT WERE MEANT FOR THE USES OF THE PUBLIC
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0238 SO ENTERING THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO STUMBLE OVER AN ASH BOX IN THE PORCH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0239 HA THOUGHT I HA AS THE FLYING PARTICLES ALMOST CHOKED ME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0240 ARE THESE ASHES FROM THAT DESTROYED CITY GOMORRAH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0241 BUT THE CROSSED HARPOONS AND THE SWORD FISH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0242 THIS THEN MUST NEEDS BE THE SIGN OF THE TRAP
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0243 HOWEVER I PICKED MYSELF UP AND HEARING A LOUD VOICE WITHIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0244 PUSHED ON AND OPENED A SECOND INTERIOR DOOR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0245 IT SEEMED THE GREAT BLACK PARLIAMENT SITTING IN TOPHET
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0246 A HUNDRED BLACK FACES TURNED ROUND IN THEIR ROWS TO PEER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0247 AND BEYOND A BLACK ANGEL OF DOOM WAS BEATING A BOOK IN A PULPIT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0248 IT WAS A NEGRO CHURCH AND THE PREACHER'S TEXT WAS ABOUT THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0249 AND THE WEEPING AND WAILING AND TEETH GNASHING THERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0250 HA ISHMAEL MUTTERED I BACKING OUT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0251 WRETCHED ENTERTAINMENT AT THE SIGN OF THE TRAP
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0252 MOVING ON I AT LAST CAME TO A DIM SORT OF LIGHT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0253 NOT FAR FROM THE DOCKS AND HEARD A FORLORN CREAKING IN THE AIR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0254 AND LOOKING UP SAW A SWINGING SIGN OVER THE DOOR WITH A WHITE PAINTING UPON IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0255 FAINTLY REPRESENTING A TALL STRAIGHT JET OF MISTY SPRAY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0256 AND THESE WORDS UNDERNEATH THE SPOUTER INN PETER COFFIN COFFIN
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0257 SPOUTER RATHER OMINOUS IN THAT PARTICULAR CONNEXION THOUGHT I
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0258 BUT IT IS A COMMON NAME IN NANTUCKET THEY SAY AND I SUPPOSE THIS PETER HERE IS AN EMIGRANT FROM THERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0259 AS THE LIGHT LOOKED SO DIM AND THE PLACE FOR THE TIME LOOKED QUIET ENOUGH AND THE DILAPIDATED LITTLE WOODEN HOUSE ITSELF LOOKED AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CARTED HERE FROM THE RUINS OF SOME BURNT DISTRICT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0260 AND AS THE SWINGING SIGN HAD A POVERTY STRICKEN SORT OF CREAK TO IT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0261 I THOUGHT THAT HERE WAS THE VERY SPOT FOR CHEAP LODGINGS AND THE BEST OF PEA COFFEE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0262 IT WAS A QUEER SORT OF PLACE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0263 A GABLE ENDED OLD HOUSE ONE SIDE PALSIED AS IT WERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0264 AND LEANING OVER SADLY IT STOOD ON A SHARP BLEAK CORNER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0265 WHERE THAT TEMPESTUOUS WIND EUROCLYDON KEPT UP A WORSE HOWLING THAN EVER IT DID ABOUT POOR PAUL'S TOSSED CRAFT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0266 EUROCLYDON NEVERTHELESS IS A MIGHTY PLEASANT ZEPHYR TO ANY ONE IN DOORS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0267 WITH HIS FEET ON THE HOB QUIETLY TOASTING FOR BED
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0268 IN JUDGING OF THAT TEMPESTUOUS WIND CALLED EUROCLYDON SAYS AN OLD WRITER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0269 OF WHOSE WORKS I POSSESS THE ONLY COPY EXTANT
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0270 IT MAKETH A MARVELLOUS DIFFERENCE WHETHER THOU LOOKEST OUT AT IT FROM A GLASS WINDOW WHERE THE FROST IS ALL ON THE OUTSIDE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0271 OR WHETHER THOU OBSERVEST IT FROM THAT SASHLESS WINDOW
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0272 WHERE THE FROST IS ON BOTH SIDES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0273 AND OF WHICH THE WIGHT DEATH IS THE ONLY GLAZIER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0274 TRUE ENOUGH THOUGHT I AS THIS PASSAGE OCCURRED TO MY MIND
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0275 OLD BLACK LETTER THOU REASONEST WELL
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0276 YES THESE EYES ARE WINDOWS AND THIS BODY OF MINE IS THE HOUSE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0277 WHAT A PITY THEY DIDN'T STOP UP THE CHINKS AND THE CRANNIES THOUGH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0278 AND THRUST IN A LITTLE LINT HERE AND THERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0279 BUT IT'S TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY IMPROVEMENTS NOW
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0280 THE UNIVERSE IS FINISHED THE COPESTONE IS ON
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0281 AND THE CHIPS WERE CARTED OFF A MILLION YEARS AGO
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0282 POOR LAZARUS THERE CHATTERING HIS TEETH AGAINST THE CURBSTONE FOR HIS PILLOW
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0283 AND SHAKING OFF HIS TATTERS WITH HIS SHIVERINGS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0284 HE MIGHT PLUG UP BOTH EARS WITH RAGS AND PUT A CORN COB INTO HIS MOUTH
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0285 AND YET THAT WOULD NOT KEEP OUT THE TEMPESTUOUS EUROCLYDON
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0286 EUROCLYDON SAYS OLD DIVES IN HIS RED SILKEN WRAPPER
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0287 HE HAD A REDDER ONE AFTERWARDS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0288 POOH POOH WHAT A FINE FROSTY NIGHT HOW ORION GLITTERS WHAT NORTHERN LIGHTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0289 LET THEM TALK OF THEIR ORIENTAL SUMMER CLIMES OF EVERLASTING CONSERVATORIES
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0290 GIVE ME THE PRIVILEGE OF MAKING MY OWN SUMMER WITH MY OWN COALS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0291 BUT WHAT THINKS LAZARUS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0292 CAN HE WARM HIS BLUE HANDS BY HOLDING THEM UP TO THE GRAND NORTHERN LIGHTS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0293 WOULD NOT LAZARUS RATHER BE IN SUMATRA THAN HERE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0294 WOULD HE NOT FAR RATHER LAY HIM DOWN LENGTHWISE ALONG THE LINE OF THE EQUATOR
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0295 YEA YE GODS GO DOWN TO THE FIERY PIT ITSELF IN ORDER TO KEEP OUT THIS FROST
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0296 NOW THAT LAZARUS SHOULD LIE STRANDED THERE ON THE CURBSTONE BEFORE THE DOOR OF DIVES THIS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0297 IS MORE WONDERFUL THAN THAT AN ICEBERG SHOULD BE MOORED TO ONE OF THE MOLUCCAS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0298 YET DIVES HIMSELF HE TOO LIVES LIKE A CZAR IN AN ICE PALACE MADE OF FROZEN SIGHS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0299 AND BEING A PRESIDENT OF A TEMPERANCE SOCIETY
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0300 HE ONLY DRINKS THE TEPID TEARS OF ORPHANS
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0301 BUT NO MORE OF THIS BLUBBERING NOW WE ARE GOING A WHALING AND THERE IS PLENTY OF THAT YET TO COME
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0302 LET US SCRAPE THE ICE FROM OUR FROSTED FEET
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0303 AND SEE WHAT SORT OF A PLACE THIS SPOUTER MAY BE
librivoxMP3-20070530-MOB-mob0304 END OF CHAPTERS ONE AND TWO
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
life4himsq-20080807-vvt-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
life4himsq-20080807-xne-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
lillorme-20140426-fmq-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0132 THERE IS NO NEED OF FURTHER DETAIL NOW  FOR YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
lindavg-20081007-adc-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
lindavg-20081007-ahj-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
lindavg-20081007-cqp-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
lindavg-20081007-eym-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
lindavg-20081007-fap-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
lindavg-20081007-heh-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
lindavg-20081007-jyk-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
lindavg-20081007-lxd-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
lindavg-20081007-ocy-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
lindavg-20081007-ovc-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
lindavg-20081007-oyi-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
lindavg-20081007-snd-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
lindavg-20081007-trz-a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
lindavg-20081007-wxe-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
lindavg-20081007-wyi-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
linforcer-20080504-plx-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
lolcatz-20130915-orx-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
lostincyberspace-20080708-msq-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
lsparrish-20120806-gni-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
lsparrish-20120806-utv-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
lsparrish-20120806-zaw-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE

luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
luismpradom-20140927-qum-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
lyndsey-20080305-gyx-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
mahasamoot-20070718-cc-cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
mahasamoot-20070719-ar-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
mahasamoot-20070719-rp-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-01 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-02 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-03 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-04 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-05 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-06 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-07 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-08 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-09 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-10 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-11 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-12 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-13 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-14 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-15 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-16 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-17 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-18 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-19 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-20 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-21 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-22 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-23 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-24 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-25 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-26 FAST BUT ENDURE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-27 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-28 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-29 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-30 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-31 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-32 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-33 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-34 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-35 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-36 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-37 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-38 ALSO I WANT INFORMATION
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-39 LET THEM GO OUT AND EAT WITH MY BOYS
mahasamoot-20070719-vf19-vf19-40 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
mahdi-20101122-rnm-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
majiq-20090809-imi-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
majiq-20090809-imi-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
majiq-20090809-imi-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
majiq-20090809-imi-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
majiq-20090809-imi-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
majiq-20090809-imi-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
majiq-20090809-imi-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
majiq-20090809-imi-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
majiq-20090809-imi-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
majiq-20090809-imi-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
majiq-20090811-iqx-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
majiq-20090811-iqx-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
majiq-20090811-iqx-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME

majiq-20090811-iqx-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
majiq-20090811-iqx-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
majiq-20090811-iqx-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
majiq-20090811-iqx-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
majiq-20090811-iqx-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
majiq-20090811-kme-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
majiq-20090811-kme-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
majiq-20090811-kme-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
majiq-20090811-kme-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
majiq-20090811-kme-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
majiq-20090811-kme-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
majiq-20090811-kme-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
majiq-20090811-kme-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
majiq-20090811-kme-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
majiq-20090811-kme-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS

mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
mariodsantana-20090427-puq-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE

mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
mariodsantana-20090427-tpl-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0131 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU

martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0133 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0134 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
martin0amy-20111106-fat-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
martin0amy-20111106-pwg-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
mcmurray-20090312-zxo-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
mcmurray02-20090312-avd-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
mcmurray02-20090312-dth-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
mcmurray02-20090312-gdv-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
mcmurray02-20090312-joh-b0299 MISS BRODIE'S SMILE WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
mcmurray02-20090312-lje-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0190 TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
mcmurray02-20090312-lqy-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
mcmurray02-20090312-oxw-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
mcmurray02-20090312-pza-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
mcmurray02-20090312-rsr-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
mcmurray02-20090312-sie-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT

mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
mcmurray02-20090312-sox-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
mcmurray02-20090312-zke-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
mertyildiran-20150422-nek-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
mertyildiran-20150422-pwp-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS

mertyildiran-20150422-pwp-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
mertyildiran-20150422-pwp-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
mertyildiran-20150422-pwp-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
mertyildiran-20150422-pwp-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
mertyildiran-20150422-pwp-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
mertyildiran-20150422-pwp-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
mertyildiran-20150422-yie-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE

meworkman-20120719-drf-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
meworkman-20120719-drf-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
meworkman-20120719-drf-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
meworkman-20120719-drf-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
meworkman-20120719-drf-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
mgfrobozz-20130824-iad-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
mgfrobozz-20130824-uug-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
mgfrobozz-20130824-vkq-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
mgmiller-20080319-fma-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
mgmiller-20080319-hvm-b0347 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
mgmiller-20080319-irt-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
mgmiller-20080319-nea-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
mgmiller-20080319-neg-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
mgmiller-20080319-ofi-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
mgmiller-20080319-ows-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0068 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0069 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
mgmiller-20080319-srh-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR

mgmiller-20080319-toq-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
mgmiller-20080319-vtf-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW

mgmiller-20080319-vtf-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
mgmiller-20080319-vtf-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
mgmiller-20080319-ygd-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
mgmiller-20080319-yxe-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
mgmiller-20080319-yxe-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
mgmiller-20080319-yxe-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
mgmiller-20080319-yxe-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
mgmiller-20080319-yxe-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID

mgmiller-20080319-yxe-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
mgmiller-20080319-yxe-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
mgmiller-20080319-yxe-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY

mike-20091218-cbk-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
mike-20091218-cbk-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
mike-20091218-cbk-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
mike-20091218-cbk-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
mike-20091218-cbk-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT

mramige-20100820-bij-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
mramige-20100820-bij-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
mramige-20100820-bij-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
mramige-20100820-dfw-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
mramige-20100820-hxj-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
mramige-20100820-kok-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
mramige-20100820-kok-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
mramige-20100820-kok-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
mramige-20100820-kok-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
mramige-20100820-kok-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
mramige-20100820-kok-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
mramige-20100820-kok-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
mramige-20100820-kok-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
mramige-20100820-kok-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
mramige-20100820-kok-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
mramige-20100820-nlo-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
mramige-20100820-qnp-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
mramige-20100820-thj-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
mramige-20100820-thj-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
mramige-20100820-thj-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
mramige-20100820-thj-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT

mramige-20100820-thj-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
mramige-20100820-thj-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
mramige-20100820-thj-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
mramige-20100820-thj-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
mramige-20100820-thj-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
mramige-20100820-tvp-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
mramige-20100820-tvp-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
mramige-20100820-zpz-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0220 HARRY BANCROFT DAVE LIED
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
mrteye-20130906-adv-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
mrteye-20130906-emo-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY

mrteye-20130906-haa-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
mrteye-20130906-haa-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
mrteye-20130906-haa-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
mrteye-20130906-haa-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
mrteye-20130906-haa-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
mrteye-20130906-haa-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
mrteye-20130906-haa-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
mrteye-20130906-wdn-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON

mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID

mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING

mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW

nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET

nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
nicksaw62-20110116-bbo-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
niimarra-20101103-bgi-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
niimarra-20101103-lzw-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
nollidj-20081101-ar-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
nollidj-20081101-cc-cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
nollidj-20081101-rp-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE

nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-08 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-09 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-10 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-11 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-12 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-13 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-14 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-15 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-16 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-17 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-18 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-19 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-20 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-21 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-22 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-23 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-24 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-25 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-26 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-27 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-28 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-29 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-30 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-31 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-32 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-33 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-34 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-35 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-36 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-37 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
nollidj-20081101-vf1-vf1-38 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES

oeginc-20080224-oao-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
oeginc-20080224-oao-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
oeginc-20080224-oao-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY

pcsnpny-20150204-clt-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
pcsnpny-20150204-clt-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
pcsnpny-20150204-dxd-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
pcsnpny-20150204-ear-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
pcsnpny-20150204-eml-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
pcsnpny-20150204-iau-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
pcsnpny-20150204-iev-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
pcsnpny-20150204-kcu-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
pcsnpny-20150204-lip-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
pcsnpny-20150204-mkj-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
pcsnpny-20150204-ntd-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0329 AH INDEED
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
pcsnpny-20150204-ofo-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
pcsnpny-20150204-oim-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
pcsnpny-20150204-qat-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
pcsnpny-20150204-rlf-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
pcsnpny-20150205-bzk-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
pcsnpny-20150205-cmx-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
pcsnpny-20150205-djt-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
pcsnpny-20150205-dvw-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
pcsnpny-20150205-eoy-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0421 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0422 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0423 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0424 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
pcsnpny-20150205-iac-b0425 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
pcsnpny-20150205-ijo-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
pcsnpny-20150205-kke-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
pcsnpny-20150205-qww-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
pcsnpny-20150205-udt-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
pcsnpny-20150205-vhp-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED

pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
pcsnpny-20150205-vtp-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
pcsnpny-20150205-xfb-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
pcsnpny-20150205-xji-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
pcsnpny-20150205-xyo-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
pcsnpny-20150206-bjh-a0219 AT FIRST HE PUZZLED OVER SOMETHING UNTOWARD HE WAS SURE HAD HAPPENED
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
pcsnpny-20150206-dti-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
pcsnpny-20150206-ehr-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
pcsnpny-20150206-emn-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
pcsnpny-20150206-kqg-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
pcsnpny-20150206-xpy-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
pcsnpny-20150206-yys-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
pcsnpny-20150221-hax-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
pcsnpny-20150221-jtu-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
pcsnpny-20150221-qyh-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
pcsnpny-20150221-roa-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH

pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
pcsnpny-20150221-tig-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
pcsnpny-20150221-xac-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
pcsnpny-20150221-zug-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
pcsnpny-20150221-zug-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
pcsnpny-20150221-zug-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
pcsnpny-20150221-zug-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID

pcsnpny-20150221-zug-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY

pcsnpny-20150221-zug-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
pcsnpny-20150221-zug-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE

pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150301-pis-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
pcsnpny-20150303-bog-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
pcsnpny-20150303-dov-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
pcsnpny-20150303-dov-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT

pcsnpny-20150303-dzk-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
pcsnpny-20150303-dzk-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
pcsnpny-20150303-dzk-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN

pcsnpny-20150303-ema-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
pcsnpny-20150303-exg-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
pcsnpny-20150303-gay-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
pcsnpny-20150303-iwd-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0329 AH INDEED
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
pcsnpny-20150303-kok-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
pcsnpny-20150303-lih-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH

pcsnpny-20150303-muu-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
pcsnpny-20150303-muu-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
pcsnpny-20150303-muu-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE

pcsnpny-20150303-nos-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
pcsnpny-20150303-nos-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
pcsnpny-20150303-nos-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
pcsnpny-20150303-nos-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
pcsnpny-20150303-nos-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU

pcsnpny-20150303-nos-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
pcsnpny-20150303-otu-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS

pcsnpny-20150303-pgl-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
pcsnpny-20150303-pgl-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
pcsnpny-20150303-pgl-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
pcsnpny-20150303-pgl-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED

pcsnpny-20150303-pgl-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
pcsnpny-20150303-pgl-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
pcsnpny-20150303-pgl-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE

pcsnpny-20150303-ucm-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
pcsnpny-20150303-ucm-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
pcsnpny-20150303-ucm-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
pcsnpny-20150303-ucm-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY

pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0155 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
pcsnpny-20150304-cdl-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
pcsnpny-20150304-frc-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
pcsnpny-20150304-ubd-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
pcsnpny-20150306-bph-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
pcsnpny-20150306-qco-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
pcsnpny-20150306-tuq-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
pcsnpny-20150307-doe-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
pcsnpny-20150307-oir-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
pcsnpny-20150307-tbm-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
pcsnpny-20150313-lxk-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150313-rdp-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
pcsnpny-20150313-tbf-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
pcsnpny-20150314-bjf-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
pcsnpny-20150314-dbt-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
pcsnpny-20150314-eiv-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME

pcsnpny-20150314-eiv-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
pcsnpny-20150314-eiv-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
pcsnpny-20150314-eiv-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
pcsnpny-20150314-eiv-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
pcsnpny-20150314-eiv-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
pcsnpny-20150314-eiv-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
pcsnpny-20150314-eiv-b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED

pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
pcsnpny-20150314-jta-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
pcsnpny-20150314-odi-a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE

pcsnpny-20150314-oqa-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
pcsnpny-20150314-oqa-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
pcsnpny-20150314-oqa-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
pcsnpny-20150314-oqa-a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE

pcsnpny-20150314-oqa-a0515 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT

pcsnpny-20150314-oqa-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
pcsnpny-20150314-oqa-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
pcsnpny-20150314-oqa-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0129 DID THORPE GO TO SEE ANY ONE IN CHURCHILL
pcsnpny-20150314-otp-b0130 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
pcsnpny-20150314-qwy-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
pcsnpny-20150314-qwy-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
pcsnpny-20150314-qwy-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE

pcsnpny-20150314-qwy-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
pcsnpny-20150314-qwy-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
pcsnpny-20150314-qwy-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
pcsnpny-20150314-qwy-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE

pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
pcsnpny-20150314-tyn-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
pcsnpny-20150317-are-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
pcsnpny-20150317-are-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED

pcsnpny-20150317-are-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
pcsnpny-20150317-are-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
pcsnpny-20150317-are-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
pcsnpny-20150317-are-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
pcsnpny-20150317-are-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
pcsnpny-20150317-dpx-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
pcsnpny-20150317-dpx-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT

pcsnpny-20150317-dpx-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
pcsnpny-20150317-dpx-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
pcsnpny-20150317-dpx-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
pcsnpny-20150317-hnn-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
pcsnpny-20150317-htb-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
pcsnpny-20150317-jok-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-06 THERE IS ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
pcsnpny-20150317-luz-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
pcsnpny-20150317-pah-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0257 THEY ARE COMING ASHORE WHOEVER THEY ARE
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
pcsnpny-20150317-qiz-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
pcsnpny-20150317-sqn-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
pcsnpny-20150317-ver-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
pcsnpny-20150321-aqn-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
pcsnpny-20150321-arx-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0206 HORSES AND RIFLES HAD BEEN HER TOYS CAMP AND TRAIL HER NURSERY
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0207 I'M AS GOOD AS A MAN SHE URGED
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0208 YOU READ THE QUOTATIONS IN TODAY'S PAPER
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0209 HE'S TERRIBLY TOUCHY ABOUT HIS BLACK WARDS AS HE CALLS THEM
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
pcsnpny-20150321-dik-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
pcsnpny-20150321-erl-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
pcsnpny-20150321-hqs-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
pcsnpny-20150321-hwk-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
pcsnpny-20150321-isg-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
pcsnpny-20150321-jvh-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
pcsnpny-20150321-kjm-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
pcsnpny-20150321-mfk-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150321-miu-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
pcsnpny-20150321-npv-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
pcsnpny-20150321-nvf-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID
pcsnpny-20150321-ohe-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
pcsnpny-20150321-ort-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
pcsnpny-20150321-ouu-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0125 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0126 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0127 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN
pcsnpny-20150321-owt-b0128 PHILIP BENT LOW OVER PIERRE
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
pcsnpny-20150321-pkx-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
pcsnpny-20150321-svv-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
pcsnpny-20150321-tch-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0303 HERE WE ALLOW OUR SOLICITORS TO LOOK AFTER OUR LEGAL WORK
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0304 HIS PREVIOUS WIVES HAD NEVER LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO BEAR HIM CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0305 IT WAS OUR RIVER EMERGING LIKE OURSELVES FROM THE GREAT SWAMP
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0306 CAMERON LOOKED AT HIS HANDS WITH THEIR LONG SINEWY FINGERS
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
pcsnpny-20150321-tik-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
pcsnpny-20150321-ucd-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
pcsnpny-20150321-uif-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
pcsnpny-20150321-uri-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
pcsnpny-20150321-vkj-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
pcsnpny-20150321-whn-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
pcsnpny-20150321-won-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0427 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
pcsnpny-20150321-wtx-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
pcsnpny-20150321-xed-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
pcsnpny-20150321-ybg-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
pcsnpny-20150321-zyw-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0113 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
pcsnpny-20150322-box-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0006 GOD BLESS EM I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
pcsnpny-20150322-zze-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
pcsnpny-20150326-jau-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
pcsnpny-20150326-mtu-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
pcsnpny-20150326-mtu-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT

pcsnpny-20150326-mtu-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
pcsnpny-20150326-mtu-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
pcsnpny-20150326-mtu-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
pcsnpny-20150326-mtu-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
pcsnpny-20150326-mtu-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
pcsnpny-20150326-qfo-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0066 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
pcsnpny-20150326-szb-a0067 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
pcsnpny-20150326-wmz-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
pcsnpny-20150504-qfm-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
pcsnpny-20150504-vbj-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0484 NO SIR EE
pcsnpny-20150508-biu-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
pcsnpny-20150508-pvl-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
pcsnpny-20150508-tdq-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
pcsnpny-20150508-zqx-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
pcsnpny-20150616-geu-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING

pcsnpny-20150708-kje-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
pcsnpny-20150708-kje-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
pcsnpny-20150708-kje-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
pcsnpny-20150708-kje-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
pcsnpny-20150708-kje-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS

pcsnpny-20150708-kje-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
pcsnpny-20150725-hur-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
pcsnpny-20150725-hur-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
pcsnpny-20150725-hur-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
pcsnpny-20150725-hur-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID
pcsnpny-20150725-hur-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
pcsnpny-20150725-hur-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER

pcsnpny-20150725-hur-a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
pcsnpny-20150725-hur-b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
pcsnpny-20150725-hur-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND

pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
pcsnpny-20150805-gom-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
pcsnpny-20150805-klf-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
pcsnpny-20150805-klf-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER

pcsnpny-20150816-aja-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
pcsnpny-20150816-aja-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
pcsnpny-20150816-aja-b0110 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0110 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0111 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
pcsnpny-20150816-ist-a0112 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
pcsnpny-20150820-iwe-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
petjal-20110303-cxb-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
petrpulc-20140215-lrv-a0109 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU

petrpulc-20140215-lrv-a0114 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
petrpulc-20140215-lrv-a0115 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
petrpulc-20140215-lrv-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
petrpulc-20140215-lrv-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
petrpulc-20140215-lrv-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
petrpulc-20140215-mdf-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
petrpulc-20140215-mdf-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
petrpulc-20140215-mdf-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
petrpulc-20140215-mdf-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL

pkkikibig-20100105-xib-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
pkkikibig-20100105-xib-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
pkkikibig-20100105-xib-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
pkkikibig-20100105-xib-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
pkkikibig-20100105-xib-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
pleabargain-20100709-cmv-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
pleabargain-20100709-tvj-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0274 AND RAOUL LISTENED AGAIN TO THE TALE OF THE HOUSE
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0275 THERE ARE NO KIDDIES AND HALF GROWN YOUTHS AMONG THEM
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
polerizer-20091226-cxd-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
polerizer-20091226-der-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
polerizer-20091226-flf-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
polerizer-20091226-iie-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
polerizer-20091226-iie-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
polerizer-20091226-iie-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
polerizer-20091226-iie-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO

polerizer-20091226-rel-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
polerizer-20091226-vdf-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
polerizer-20091226-wre-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
polerizer-20091226-wre-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
polerizer-20091226-wre-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
polerizer-20091226-wre-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
polerizer-20091231-nfw-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
polerizer-20091231-oon-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
polerizer-20091231-oon-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
polerizer-20091231-oon-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
polerizer-20091231-oon-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
polerizer-20091231-oon-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
polerizer-20091231-oon-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST

polerizer-20091231-upo-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
polerizer-20091231-upo-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
polerizer-20091231-upo-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
polerizer-20091231-upo-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
polerizer-20091231-upo-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
polerizer-20091231-upo-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED

polyscient-20100201-yhf-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
polyscient-20100201-yhf-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
polyscient-20100201-yhf-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
polyscient-20100201-yhf-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
polyscient-20100201-yhf-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
poorsquinky-20111018-mmw-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
poorsquinky-20111018-mmw-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
poorsquinky-20111018-mmw-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
poorsquinky-20111018-mmw-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
poorsquinky-20111018-mmw-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
poorsquinky-20111018-mmw-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY

poorsquinky-20111018-xyg-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
poorsquinky-20111018-xyg-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
poorsquinky-20111018-xyg-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
poorsquinky-20111018-xyg-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
poorsquinky-20111018-xyg-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
poorsquinky-20111018-xyg-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS

ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-080 CAN SHE IMAGINE THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-101 HE HAS GOT TO STOP IT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-102 STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOW
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-103 THAT MAN WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-104 WHY DOESN'T SHE CALL HIM

ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-107 SHE DOESN'T SEE ANYTHING
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-108 SHE IS NEVER GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT

ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-115 THAT IS WHY HE IS COMING
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-116 HE HAS BEEN WORKING ON IT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-117 SHE IS IMPORTANT TO HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-118 SHE IS GOING TO FACE IT BY HERSELF
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-119 HIS DAD IS AN EXPERT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-120 SHE IS STANDING AROUND
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-121 IT IS UP TO HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-122 THAT IS THE WAY IT GOES

ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-125 HE IS GUESSING THIS ISN'T A GOOD SIGN
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-126 HE HAS TO CLOSE THE DOOR
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-127 HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-128 THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-129 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-130 BUT SHE CAN'T BE WITH HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-131 HE NEVER TRIED TO HIDE WHO HE WAS
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-132 HE IS JUST WORRIED ABOUT HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-133 HE SHOULD TALK TO HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-134 SHE IS STAYING WITH HIM NOW
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-135 MAYBE THEY SHOULD GET SOME HELP
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-136 IT IS GOOD TO KNOW WHAT HE IS USING
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-137 THEY WILL SEND SOMEONE OUT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-138 IS SHE HAVING A MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-139 THE DOOR WON'T OPEN
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-140 MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT A PRIEST
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-141 HE IS NOT SAYING TOMORROW
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-142 SHE IS SEEING THIS IN HER DREAMS
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-143 WHY CAN'T YOU TELL HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-144 SHE IS SAFE WITH HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-145 SHE DOESN'T KNOW SHE CAN'T REMEMBER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-146 WHAT IS SHE WATCHING
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-147 HE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE HUNGRY
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-148 THEY ARE GIVING HER A LITTLE SPACE
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-149 THEY NEED TO GIVE HER TIME
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-150 IT IS TOO SOON
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-151 WHAT HE SAW WAS JUMBLED
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-152 WHY SHOULD HE GO TO AN OFFICE EVERY DAY
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-153 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-154 SO HE JUST LEFT AFTER DINNER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-155 WHAT HAS SHE MISSED
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-156 SHE HAS SOMETHING FOR HER CLIENT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-157 WHY IS HE HERE
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-158 SHE JUST WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-159 SHE HAD A GREAT TIME LAST NIGHT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-160 WHAT IS THE MATTER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-161 SHE WILL GET HER COAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-162 SHE HASN'T SEEN HIM ALL DAY
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-163 SHE IS TOO GOOD FOR HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-164 I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-165 DID HE TELL YOU THAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-166 WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-167 WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-168 HOW CAN YOU PREVENT THAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-169 SHE THINKS THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-170 THAT IS NOT EVEN FUNNY
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-171 SHE DOUBTS ANYBODY WOULD BELIEVE HIM
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-172 DID SHE COMPLAIN TO HER EMPLOYER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-173 CAN SHE GIVE THEM AN EXAMPLE
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-174 SHE THINKS HE ASKED HER OUT ON A DATE
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-175 MAYBE THEY SHOULD WORK ON THAT
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-176 IS IT BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIENDS
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-177 SHE IS NOT GOING TO TRICK HIM AGAIN
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-178 DON'T THEY HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-179 IS HE DISTURBING HER
ralfherog-20070918-en7-en7-180 SHE IS DRIVING IN HER CAR
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-01 WELL HERE'S A STORY FOR YOU SARAH PERRY WAS A VETERINARY NURSE
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-02 WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAILY AT AN OLD ZOO IN A DESERTED DISTRICT OF THE TERRITORY
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-03 SO SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO START A NEW JOB AT A SUPERB PRIVATE PRACTICE
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-04 IN NORTH SQUARE NEAR THE DUKE STREET TOWER
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-05 THAT AREA WAS MUCH NEARER FOR HER AND MORE TO HER LIKING
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-06 EVEN SO ON HER FIRST MORNING SHE FELT STRESSED
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-07 SHE ATE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE CHECKED HERSELF IN THE MIRROR
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-08 AND WASHED HER FACE IN A HURRY THEN SHE PUT ON A PLAIN YELLOW DRESS
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-09 AND A FLEECE JACKET PICKED UP HER KIT AND HEADED FOR WORK
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-10 WHEN SHE GOT THERE THERE WAS A WOMAN WITH A GOOSE WAITING FOR HER
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-11 THE WOMAN GAVE SARAH AN OFFICIAL LETTER FROM THE VET
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-12 THE LETTER IMPLIED THAT THE ANIMAL COULD BE SUFFERING FROM A RARE FORM
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-13 OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-14 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU WOULD ONLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN A DOG OR A GOAT
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-15 SARAH WAS SENTIMENTAL SO THIS MADE HER FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-16 BEFORE LONG THAT ITCHY GOOSE BEGAN TO STRUT AROUND THE OFFICE LIKE A LUNATIC
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-17 WHICH MADE AN UNSANITARY MESS
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-18 THE GOOSE'S OWNER MARY HARRISON KEPT CALLING COMMA COMMA
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-19 WHICH SARAH THOUGHT WAS AN ODD CHOICE FOR A NAME
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-20 COMMA WAS STRONG AND HUGE SO IT WOULD TAKE SOME FORCE TO TRAP HER
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-21 BUT SARAH HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-22 FIRST SHE TRIED GENTLY STROKING THE GOOSE'S LOWER BACK WITH HER PALM
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-23 THEN SINGING A TUNE TO HER FINALLY SHE ADMINISTERED ETHER
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-24 HER EFFORTS WERE NOT FUTILE IN NO TIME THE GOOSE BEGAN TO TIRE
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-25 SO SARAH WAS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO COMMA AND GIVE HER A RELAXING BATH
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-26 ONCE SARAH HAD MANAGED TO BATHE THE GOOSE SHE WIPED HER OFF WITH A CLOTH
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-27 AND LAID HER ON HER RIGHT SIDE THEN SARAH CONFIRMED THE VET'S DIAGNOSIS
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-28 ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SHE REMEMBERED AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-29 THAT REQUIRED HER TO MEASURE OUT A LOT OF MEDICINE
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-30 SARAH WARNED THAT THIS COURSE OF TREATMENT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-31 EITHER FIVE OR SIX TIMES THE COST OF PENICILLIN
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-32 I CAN'T IMAGINE PAYING SO MUCH BUT MRS HARRISON A MILLIONAIRE LAWYER
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-33 THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CURE
ralfherzog-20070803-cc-34 COMMA GETS A CURE AND DERIVATIVE WORKS MAY BE USED FREELY FOR ANY PURPOSE

ralfherzog-20070810-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
ralfherzog-20070810-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
ralfherzog-20070812-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-01 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-02 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-03 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-04 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-05 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-06 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-07 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-08 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-09 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-10 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-11 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-12 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-13 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-14 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-15 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-16 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-17 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-18 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-19 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-20 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-21 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-22 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-23 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-24 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-25 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-26 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-27 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-28 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-29 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-30 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-31 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-32 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-33 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-34 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-35 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-36 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-37 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-38 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-39 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
ralfherzog-20070813_vf12-vf12-40 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-01 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-02 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-03 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-04 NO SIR EE
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-05 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-06 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-07 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-08 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-09 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-10 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-11 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-12 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-13 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-14 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-15 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-16 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-17 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-18 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-19 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-20 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-21 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-22 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-23 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-24 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-25 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-26 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-27 IN SHORT MY JOYOUS INDIVIDUALISM WAS DOMINATED BY THE ORTHODOX BOURGEOIS ETHICS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-28 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-29 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-30 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-31 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-32 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-33 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-34 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH POTS
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-35 BUT HERE AMONGST OURSELVES LET US SPEAK OUT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-36 ALSO THERE WAS AWE IN THEIR FACES
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-37 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-38 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-39 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
ralfherzog-20070814_vf13-vf13-40 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-01 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-02 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-03 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-04 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-05 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-06 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-07 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-08 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-09 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-10 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-11 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-12 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-13 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-14 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-15 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-16 HE WOULD DESTROY ALL THINGS THAT ARE FIXED
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-17 HE WAS AN ENTHUSIAST AND A DESERT DWELLER
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-18 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-19 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-20 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-21 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-22 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-23 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-24 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-25 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-26 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-27 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-28 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-30 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-31 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-32 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY

ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-34 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-35 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-36 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-37 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-38 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-39 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
ralfherzog-20070815_vf14-vf14-40 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-01 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-02 WHAT THE FLAMING
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-03 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP

ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-06 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-07 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-08 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT

ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-10 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-11 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-12 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-13 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-14 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-15 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW

ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-24 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-25 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-26 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-27 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-28 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-29 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-30 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-31 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-32 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-33 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-34 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-35 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-36 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-37 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-38 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-39 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
ralfherzog-20070816_vf15-vf15-40 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-01 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-02 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-03 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-04 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-05 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-06 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-07 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-08 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-09 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-10 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-11 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-12 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-13 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-14 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-15 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-16 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-17 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-18 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-19 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-20 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-21 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-22 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-23 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-24 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-25 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-26 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-27 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-28 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-29 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-30 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-31 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-32 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-33 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-34 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-35 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-36 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-37 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-38 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-39 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
ralfherzog-20070818_vf16-vf16-40 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-01 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-02 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-03 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-04 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-05 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-06 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-07 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-08 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-09 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-10 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-11 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-12 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-13 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-14 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-15 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-16 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-17 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-18 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-19 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-20 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-21 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-22 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-23 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-24 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-25 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-26 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-27 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-28 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-29 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-30 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-31 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-32 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-33 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-34 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-35 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-36 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-37 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-38 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-39 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
ralfherzog-20070819_vf17-vf17-40 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-01 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-02 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-03 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-04 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-05 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-06 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-07 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-08 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-09 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-10 SUCH MEN BELIEVE WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-11 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-12 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-13 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-14 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-15 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-16 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP

ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-23 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-24 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-25 IT WAS THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THAT PHILIP HAD HEARD MACDOUGALL SWEAR
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-26 BLOOD WAS OOZING SLOWLY FROM THE WOUNDED MAN'S RIGHT BREAST
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-27 HE DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WOMAN

ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-30 SHE SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-31 THORPE AND HIS MEN WERE TO DESTROY THIS CAMP AND KILL YOU

ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-33 THERE FOLLOWED A ROAR THAT SHOOK THE EARTH
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-34 BLIND WITH RAGE HE DARTED IN
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-35 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-36 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-37 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-38 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-39 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
ralfherzog-20070820_vf18-vf18-40 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-01 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-02 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-03 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-04 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-05 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-06 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-07 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-08 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-09 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-10 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-11 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-12 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-13 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-14 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-15 HIS FRESHLY CAUGHT FURS HE FLUNG TO THE FLOOR
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-16 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-17 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-18 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-19 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-20 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-21 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-22 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-23 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-24 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-25 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-26 FAST BUT ENDURE
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-27 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-28 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-29 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-30 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-31 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-32 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-33 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-34 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
ralfherzog-20070822_vf19-vf19-35 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER

ralfherzog-20070823_vf20-vf20-08 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20-vf20-09 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20-vf20-10 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20-vf20-11 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
ralfherzog-20070823_vf20-vf20-12 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED

ralfherzog-20070824_vf21-vf21-17 THEY JUST LAY OFF IN THE BUSH AND PLUGGED AWAY
ralfherzog-20070824_vf21-vf21-18 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING

ralfherzog-20070825_vf22-vf22-12 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22-vf22-13 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22-vf22-14 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID

ralfherzog-20070825_vf22-vf22-30 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22-vf22-31 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22-vf22-32 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
ralfherzog-20070825_vf22-vf22-33 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES

ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-02 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-03 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-04 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-05 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-06 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-07 BUT EVER HIS GAZE RETURNED TO THAT CROUCHED VENUS ON THE PIANO
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-08 WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED WITH THAT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF ME
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-09 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-10 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-11 MATTHEWSON WHO'S THIS BOOKKEEPER ROGERS
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-12 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-13 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-14 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-15 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-16 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-17 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-18 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-19 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-20 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-21 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTZE RIVER
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-22 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-23 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-24 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-25 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-26 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-27 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-28 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-29 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-30 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-31 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-32 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-33 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-34 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-35 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-36 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-37 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-38 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-39 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
ralfherzog-20070827_vf24-vf24-40 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-01 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-02 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-03 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-04 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-05 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-06 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-07 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-08 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-09 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-10 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-11 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-12 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-13 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-14 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-15 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-16 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-17 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-18 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-19 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-20 HOW COULD I ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-21 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-22 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-23 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-24 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-25 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-26 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-27 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-28 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-29 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-30 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-31 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-32 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-33 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-34 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-35 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-36 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-37 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-38 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-39 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
ralfherzog-20070830_vf25-vf25-40 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-001 THIS IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-002 NOW ALL I NEED IS A LITTLE HELP HE IS VERY GOOD
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-003 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO FIRST
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-004 WE HAVEN'T HAD A VACATION IN A WHILE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-005 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-006 I KNOW YOU ARE HERE WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-007 WE HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-008 YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HER
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-009 SHE IS FASTER THAN SHE LOOKS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-010 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE THAT FAST
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-011 HE IS AT HOME THIS IS WHAT I REALIZE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-012 SHE NEEDS YOU NO LONGER I NEED HER
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-013 I KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-014 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU IN PERSON
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-015 I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THAT GET ME OUT OF HERE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-016 DO YOU THINK HE FOUND HIM I WANTED TO DO THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-017 THEY ARE FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-018 ARE YOU HERE OR NOT GET RID OF HIM
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-019 THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-020 I HAD NO CHOICE THAT WAS JUST A JOKE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-021 I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE I AM NOT SLOW
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-022 I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU I CAN FIX THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-023 I AM GOING TO ASK ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-024 YOU HAVE TO BE QUIET NOW
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-025 YOU LEFT ME ALL ALONE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-026 I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO BREATHE AGAIN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-027 IT COULD HAVE BEEN TOO LATE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-028 I DON'T REMEMBER WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-029 IT IS ASSUMED THAT THESE VALUES HAVE BEEN ORDERED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-030 THE LOWEST AND THE HIGHEST QUARTER OF VALUES HAVE BEEN REMOVED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-031 IT IS A SPECIFIED EXAMPLE OF A TRUNCATED MEAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-032 THE NUMBERS ARE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO THEIR PRODUCT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-033 THOSE NUMBERS ARE DEFINED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-034 IN RELATION TO THE DISTANCE PER UNIT OF TIME
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-035 A LOT OF DISTRIBUTIONS ARE BEST DESCRIBED BY THEIR MEAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-036 THE MEAN IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE MEDIAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-037 THOSE MEANS AREN'T OF MUCH USE IN STATISTICS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-038 MEANS ARE OFTEN USED IN ANALYSIS AND GEOMETRY
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-039 THE MEAN DESCRIBES THE CENTRAL LOCATION OF THE DATA
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-040 THE MEAN IS THE SUM OF OBSERVATIONS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-041 THAT HAS TO BE DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-042 NOT EVERY PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION HAS A DEFINED MEAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-043 THE ARITHMETIC MEAN IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE GEOMETRIC MEAN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-044 THE CHECKSUM SHOULD BE ADDED
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-045 THE OUTPUT WILL BE SAVED IN COMPRESSED FORMAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-046 THE SIGNAL WILL BE USING COEFFICIENT OF TEN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-047 THE VARIABLE SHOULD BE SET TO TRUE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-048 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO CREATE CODED DATA
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-049 THOSE ARE THE RELEVANT TOOLS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-050 WHAT IS THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT FILE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-051 THOSE ARE THE FIRST FEW LINES
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-052 WE HAVE TO AVOID SEVERAL THOUSAND ARGUMENTS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-053 THEY HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-054 A DIFFERENT PROCEDURE IS USED TO CODE THE SPEECH DATA
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-055 MULTIPLE PRONUNCIATIONS ARE POSSIBLE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-056 WHAT IS THE LENGTH OF THE VECTOR
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-057 THIS IS REALLY DISGUSTING WHERE ARE WE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-058 CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC I AM SURE ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-059 THE WHEEL IS ALREADY SPINNING LET HIM PLAY
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-060 HE IS USING HIM TO DESTROY PEOPLE'S LIVES
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-061 I WASN'T AWAY YOU NEEDED SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-062 YOU DON'T KNOW THE HELL I HAVE BEEN THROUGH
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-063 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY EMBARRASSING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-064 THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-065 I WOULD KNOW I WAS RIGHT SHE IS GOING TO BE FINE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-066 I AM REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER LET'S FIND OUT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-067 YOU ARE FEELING REALLY BAD ABOUT THIS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-068 WE HAVE TO GET A GOOD COVERAGE OF PHONEMES
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-069 I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-070 IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE THANK YOU
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-071 I DON'T BELIEVE THAT CONGRATULATIONS I DON'T UNDERSTAND
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-072 WHERE ARE YOU SITTING AT YOUR DESK
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-073 TOMORROW MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST TIME
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-074 I AM SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU I NEED IT TO WORK
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-075 I THINK NOW IS A GOOD TIME
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-076 CAN WE JUST DO THIS LATER LATER WOULD BE MUCH BETTER
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-077 I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE BRILLIANT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-078 I DON'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-079 WHERE ARE YOU GOING I AM GOING TO PARIS
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-080 THIS IS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE FORM OF EXERCISE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-081 I WISH I COULD REMEMBER ME TOO
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-082 IT WAS PRETTY SPECIAL
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-083 YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-084 SHOULDN'T SOMEONE ANSWER THAT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-085 I WAS JUST SO HAPPY TO SEE HER ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-086 THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-087 HE THINKS SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF AMNESIA
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-088 YOU HAVE BEEN GONE FOR A WHILE BUT YOU ARE SAFE NOW
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-089 WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER

ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-094 IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-095 THAT IS NOT TRUE I WANT TO GO HOME NOW
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-096 IS THIS YOUR FAMILY
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-097 YOU GUYS ARE JUST IN TIME I WILL JUMP
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-098 MY FATHER IS TRYING TO GET US HOME

ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-101 THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE ARE PART OF MY DESTINY
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-102 I DON'T GET WHY OR HOW I WAS ABLE TO FIGHT
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-103 I WAS JUST THINKING IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-104 ARE YOU PLAYING GAMES WITH ME I PLAY TO WIN
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-105 WHAT DO YOU SAY

ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-110 WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-111 NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM OR WILL
ralfherzog-20070831-en1-en1-112 YOU REALLY BELIEVE I WOULD DO THAT
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-001 SHE WAS JUST DOING HER JOB
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-002 IT IS A SURPRISE THAT IT TOOK HIM SO LONG
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-003 HOW MUCH DID SHE GET SHE TRICKED US
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-004 AND THEY WERE AFTER WHAT SHE SAW
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-005 WHO DID THIS WHAT HAPPENED
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-006 GIVE HIM TIME AND HE WILL SEE THE TRUTH
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-007 HE KNOWS YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-008 SHE DOESN'T THINK THAT IS THE BEST IDEA
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-009 I SHOULD PROBABLY GET YOU BACK HOME
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-010 I AM SURE SHE IS TAKING EXCELLENT CARE OF HIM
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-011 THEY DIDN'T FIND HER HE DIDN'T JUST SHOW UP
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-012 I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST OR WHAT TO DO
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-013 SHE HAS LOST EVERYTHING AND IS STILL STRONG
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-014 DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GO
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-015 YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAS TOLD ME THE TRUTH
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-016 YOU ARE HIS DAUGHTER WHY DON'T YOU LIVE WITH HIM
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-017 YOU HAVE TO SIGN IT AS PROOF
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-018 SHE CALLED THIS A RELATIONSHIP
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-019 HE KNOWS ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-020 BUT IT IS NOT SAFE DOES IT MATTER
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-021 DID YOU MENTION THE SINGING
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-022 THEY MUST KNOW YOU ARE BACK I CAN EXPLAIN
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-023 IS SOMEBODY DOWN HERE WE SHOULD GO UPSTAIRS
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-024 THE PARTIAL PROBABILITY WILL BE CALCULATED FROM THE PREVIOUS STATE
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-025 WE ARE TRYING TO CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-026 OF A LONG OBSERVATION SEQUENCE
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-027 YOU HAVE TO SIMPLY DEFINE THE VECTOR SIZE AND THE PARAMETER KIND
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-028 MOST OF THE FILES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-029 IT WILL SCAN A SET OF SPEECH FILES
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-030 THE NEW MODEL WILL BE STORED IN THE DIRECTORY
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-031 THEY ACT AS A HARDENING AGENT AND PREVENT DISLOCATIONS
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-032 NOBODY IS GOING TO FIND US HERE
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-033 WE HOPE FOR AN ANSWER THAT DOESN'T HURT
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-034 SHE CAN'T DO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-035 SHE JUST WANTS TO HELP
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-036 WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE GAVE ME THIS
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-037 HE BROUGHT THIS FOR HER HE GAVE IT TO HER BEFORE HE LEFT
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-038 SHE WILL BE AFRAID AND SHE WILL BE ALONE
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-039 IF SHE WOULDN'T DO THOSE THINGS PEOPLE WOULD LET HER ALONE
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-040 SHE DOESN'T WANT TO HURT PEOPLE
ralfherzog-20070903-en2-en2-041 WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT HER

ralfherzog-20070911-en4-en4-88 SO DOES HE DO ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20070911-en4-en4-89 HE IS NOT TELLING HIM A DAMN THING

ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-01 SHE IS ESSENTIALLY THE LIFE GIVING LIFE CONSERVING FEMALE OF THE SPECIES
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-02 THIS WAS WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-03 ALSO AT REGULAR INTERVALS HE WOULD MUTTER
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-04 IT IS A VERY TENABLE HYPOTHESIS AND WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-05 THERE WERE ORANGE GREEN GOLD GREEN AND A COPPER GREEN
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-06 THE GABRIEL VOICE OF THE SAMURAI RANG OUT
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-07 THE SUNSETS GROW MORE BIZARRE AND SPECTACULAR OFF THIS COAST OF THE ARGENTINE
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-08 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-09 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-10 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-11 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-12 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-13 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-14 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-15 WELL DID THEY EAT
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-16 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-17 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-18 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-19 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-20 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-21 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-22 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-23 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-24 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-25 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-26 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-27 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-28 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-29 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-30 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-31 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-32 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-33 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-34 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-35 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-36 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-37 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-38 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-39 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
ralfherzog-20070912-vf26-vf26-40 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-01 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-02 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-03 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-04 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-05 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-06 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-07 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-08 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-09 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-10 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-11 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-12 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-13 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-14 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-15 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-16 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-17 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-18 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-19 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-20 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-21 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-22 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-23 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-24 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-25 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-26 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS

ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-29 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-30 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE

ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-36 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-37 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-38 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
ralfherzog-20070913-vf27-vf27-39 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT

ralfherzog-20070914-en5-en5-20 HE CAN'T BELIEVE SHE TALKED TO THE OFFICE YESTERDAY

ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-22 SHE JUST WANTED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T DO A BAD JOB

ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-27 HOW DID HE GET IN HERE

ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-30 THAT IS WHAT HE LIKES TO HEAR
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-31 SHE WILL SEE HIM IN CLASS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-32 HE CAN'T THINK OF THEM RIGHT NOW
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-33 HARD DRIVES ARE MOVING AT VERY HIGH SPEED
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-34 THEY HAVE LESS CAPACITY AND TEND TO BE SLOWER
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-35 THE MAGNETIC REGION FORMS THE MAGNETIC DIPOLE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-36 IT IS COMPOSED OF MAGNETIC GRAINS

ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-47 A HARD DISK DRIVE IS A STORAGE DEVICE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-48 IT STORES DIGITALLY ENCODED DATA
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-49 THE DEVICE IS DISTINCT FROM ITS MEDIUM
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-50 THIS SHOWS AN INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-51 THEY ARE PLANNING TO REPLACE THE CURRENT PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE

ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-64 IT MUST HAVE COST A FORTUNE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-65 HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO IN THERE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-66 HOW MUCH DID HE GET

ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-74 HE IS GOING TO SAY THIS ONCE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-75 HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE WOULD DO FOR HIM
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-76 HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE ALL ANSWERED SOON
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-77 HE IS YELLING AT HER
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-78 SHE THINKS THAT IS THE SORT OF THING SHE REMEMBERS
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-79 HE COULDN'T HANDLE THE COMPETITION
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-80 SHE JUST NEEDS SOME TIME TO THINK
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-81 THERE IS A LOT SHE NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-82 DOES HE KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT PAYBACK
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-83 HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
ralfherzog-20070917-en6-en6-84 DOES SHE REMEMBER EVERYTHING THEY WENT OVER

ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-002 WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED
ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-003 THEY NEED HIM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF

ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-005 THAT IS ALL HE HAS TO SAY
ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-006 WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT DOES SHE THINK
ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-007 DON'T GET ME WRONG

ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-021 SHE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO WALKING HOME
ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-022 SHE IS LESS AFRAID OF BEING ALONE
ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-023 SHE DOESN'T NEED CHEMICALS
ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-024 SHE TRIED TO BE SWEET
ralfherzog-20070923-en8-en8-025 SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT THAT

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-022 IT IS A HUGE STORY
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-023 SHOULD THEY SEND SOMEONE AFTER HIM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-024 SHE IS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT HIM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-025 WHY DOES HE HAVE HER HERE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-026 SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE HIM

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-028 WHAT DOES HE WANT HER TO DO
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-029 SHE WANTS IMMUNITY
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-030 HE DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-032 HE KNOWS THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE IS GOING THROUGH
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-033 HE IS LISTENING PUT HIM ON THE PHONE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-034 HE IS NOT COOPERATING
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-035 WHAT ELSE IS SHE GIVING HIM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-036 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE SHE IS UNDER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-037 HOW MUCH ARE THEY PAYING HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-038 HOW COULD SHE DO THIS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-039 THEY HAVE SOMEONE IN CUSTODY
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-040 WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE IS HE IN
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-041 ARE THEY REALLY IN TROUBLE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-042 HE WAS JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-043 AND HE WANTS HER TO PICK IT UP
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-044 SHE IS IN BIG TROUBLE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-045 TAKE A COUPLE OF SECONDS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-046 SHE NEEDS TIME TO THINK

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-049 SHE IS LISTENING DOES HE HEAR HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-050 SHE CAN'T PROMISE HIM ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-051 HE IS MAKING A MISTAKE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-052 THAT BOUGHT THEM TIME AND THEY SHOULD USE IT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-053 WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM THEM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-054 THEY SHOULD START THE OTHER LINE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-055 THEY NEED MEDICAL HELP
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-056 SHE IS NOT SAYING ANYTHING UNTIL SHE GETS IMMUNITY
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-057 WHERE DID SHE GET THAT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-058 HE WON'T FIGHT HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-059 THE DIAGRAM SHOWS A PARTICULAR ARCHITECTURE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-060 THE CONTROL SYSTEM DECODES THE INSTRUCTIONS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-061 THIS DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF THE CPU
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-062 THE COMPUTER CHANGED THE ORDER OF SOME INSTRUCTIONS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-063 THEY AREN'T COMPOSED OF MANY SEPARATE COMPONENTS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-064 IT IS KNOWN AS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-065 PROGRAMS MAKE COMPUTERS EXTREMELY VERSATILE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-066 YOU CAN DISTINGUISH CALCULATORS FROM COMPUTERS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-067 THEY ARE ABLE TO EXECUTE AND STORE LISTS OF INSTRUCTIONS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-068 THEY MAY BE FOUND IN DIGITAL CAMERAS AND INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-069 COMPUTERS ARE OFTEN USED TO CONTROL SEVERAL DEVICES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-070 THOSE ARE SMALL AND SIMPLE DEVICES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-071 THE EMBEDDED COMPUTER IS THE MOST COMMON FORM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-072 PERSONAL COMPUTERS ARE THE ICONS OF THE INFORMATION AGE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-073 THEY ARE OCCUPYING A FRACTION OF THE SPACE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-074 THEY ARE BASED ON TINY INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-075 THOSE COMPUTERS HAD THE SIZE OF A LARGE ROOM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-076 A COMPUTER MANIPULATES DATA
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-077 THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMON DEFINITIONS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-078 THERE IS SOME CONFUSION WITH THIS CONCEPT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-079 THERE IS A RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-080 SHE ISN'T SURE SHE BELIEVES HIM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-081 SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE IS

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-093 SHE JUST WANTS THEM TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-094 BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-095 SHE DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO KEEP IT FROM HIM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-096 SHE WAS DISTANT AND PREOCCUPIED
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-097 SHE IS SURE IT WAS A MISSION
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-098 TELL HER WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THEM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-099 IT IS A LITTLE BETTER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-100 HE IS GOING TO BE HERE IN A FEW MINUTES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-101 SHE DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME DID SHE

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-105 SHE HAS TO TAKE IT SEND IT TO HER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-106 HE IS SURPRISED SHE WAITED THIS LONG
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-107 THINGS CONTINUE TO GO WRONG
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-108 THIS WOULD BE INTOLERABLE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-109 THEY HAD SOME BAD LUCK THAT IS ALL
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-110 SHE HELPS HIM NAVIGATE THROUGH TRAFFIC
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-111 THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE IN A FEW MINUTES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-112 HE FOUND SOMETHING ON HER COMPUTER
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-113 HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THIS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-114 THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-115 THEY HAVE LOCATED HIS CAR
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-116 THEY DIDN'T GET IT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-117 WHO DID SHE CALL
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-118 THEY SHOULD STAY ON THE PHONE

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-131 THEY ARE CLOSING IN ON IT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-132 THEY ARE USEFUL FOR CREATING COMPLICATED CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-133 THE COMPUTER IS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING SEVERAL CLASSES OF OPERATIONS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-134 THERE ARE SOME MORE COMPLEX CPU DESIGNS
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-135 THE HARDWARE IS PERFORMING THE REQUESTED OPERATION
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-136 THE INSTRUCTION REQUIRES A SPECIALIZED HARDWARE TO COMPLETE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-137 THE DATA IS TYPICALLY STORED WITHIN THE INSTRUCTION CODE
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-138 IT IS POINTING TO THE NEXT INSTRUCTION
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-139 DECODE THE NUMERICAL CODE INTO A SET OF COMMANDS

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-146 THEY HAVE GOT OTHER THINGS TO DEAL WITH
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-147 HE NEEDS TO KNOW IF SHE HAS TALKED TO HIM

ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-158 IF HE COOPERATES WITH HER NOW SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP HIM
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-159 SHE JUST COULD HAVE USED A FEW MORE MINUTES
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-160 SHE WAS REVIEWING THE REPORT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-161 WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT
ralfherzog-20070924-en9-en9-162 THEY ARE TRACING THE CALL

ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-104 ONLY TWO LOGICAL VALUES ARE POSSIBLE
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-105 TRUTH TABLES FOR CLASSICAL LOGIC ARE LIMITED SPECIFIC LOGICAL SYSTEMS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-106 THIS PROPOSITIONAL VARIABLE IS A PROPOSITIONAL EXPRESSION
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-107 A PROPOSITIONAL EXPRESSION IS A PROPOSITIONAL CONSTANT OR A PROPOSITIONAL FUNCTION TERM
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-108 IT WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY A POINT THAT IS NOT IN THE UNION
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-109 THEY CAN COMPUTE THE VALUES OF PROPOSITIONAL EXPRESSIONS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-110 ALL LEGITIMATE INPUT VALUES ARE LOGICALLY VALID
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-111 THE PROPOSITIONAL EXPRESSION IS TRUE FOR ALL INPUT VALUES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-112 FOR THOSE VALUES ARE TAKEN BY THEIR LOGICAL VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-113 WHAT ARE THEIR FUNCTIONAL ARGUMENTS
ralfherzog-20071001-en10-en10-114 THE TRUTH TABLE IS USED TO COMPUTE THE FUNCTIONAL VALUES OF LOGICAL EXPRESSIONS

ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-070 IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO TELL THAT THE PROGRAM WAS RUN
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-071 THERE ARE TWO THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-072 IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE INSTALLED ON THE OPERATING SYSTEM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-073 THEY PREFER AUDIO SUBMISSIONS WITHOUT ANY NOISE REDUCTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-074 THE WAVEFORM IS NOT CORRECTLY CENTERED
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-075 YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT WHEN YOU ARE RECORDING AUDIO
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-076 WHAT IS IT AND HOW CAN I REMOVE IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-077 WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-078 THEY ARE TRYING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-079 THIS IS A NEW INFORMATION FOR EVERY ONE OF US
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-080 I AM TRYING TO GET THIS INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-081 YOU WILL ALSO NEED A FLOPPY DISK TO STORE INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-082 CHOOSE A PLACE TO SAVE YOUR BACKUP

ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-084 HE HAS ONLY A MATHEMATICAL CHANCE TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-085 SHE IS DETERMINING SOMETHING BY MATHEMATICAL METHODS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-086 DO YOU WANT TO WORK AFTER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-087 HOW MANY PEOPLE HAS HE EMPLOYED
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-088 IS HER HUSBAND WORKING AGAIN
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-089 HE IS WORKING UNDER A SUBCONTRACT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-090 HE ALREADY HAS THE ENTIRE WAVEFORM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-091 THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO BRING JUSTICE TO THE STREETS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-092 THE SERIES IS ABOUT AN EXPERIMENTAL DIVISION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-093 THIS SEASON WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-094 THIS IS A DIFFERENT WAVEFORM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-095 THAT WAS HIS BEST SUBJECT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-096 THE SUBJECT WAS OBSERVED LEAVING THE SCENE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-097 ALL FINAL ENTRIES WILL BE APPROVED BY THE EDITOR OF THE DICTIONARY

ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-101 THEY DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-102 THEY HAVE VERIFIED THE TRANSCRIPTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-103 THE TRANSCRIPTION IS BASED ON ONLY ONE SOURCE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-104 SEVERAL SOURCES WERE PREPROCESSED
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-105 THEY WILL CONSIDER THEM FOR AN UPCOMING VERSION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-106 THOSE WORDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-107 THEY GENERATED THIS DICTIONARY USING SEVERAL INDEPENDENT SOURCES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-108 THE PHONE SET CONTAINS THIRTY NINE PHONES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-109 THEY USE THESE DICTIONARIES IN THEIR SYSTEMS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-110 IT IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS AN INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL COMMAND
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-111 TAKE THE TIME TO SUBMIT SOME SPEECH TO THE PROJECT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-112 THEY NEED MUCH MORE TRANSCRIBED SPEECH AUDIO
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-113 THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ENGINE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-114 THE QUALITY OF SPEECH RECOGNITION IS FAIR
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-115 FOR INFORMATION ON THE GRAMMAR SYNTAX SEE THE ENCLOSED NOTES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-116 CHANGE THE DIRECTORY TO THE FOLDER WHERE YOU EXTRACT THE FILE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-117 SIMPLY EXTRACT THE FILE TO A DIRECTORY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-118 THE FILE CONTAINS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO GET THE PROGRAM WORKING
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-119 THE PROGRAM IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE USEFUL
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-120 IT CONTAINS MUCH DATA BUT NOT MUCH INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-121 THIS CAN BE USED IN THE AREA OF IMAGE PROCESSING
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-122 THIS PROGRAM IS FREE SOFTWARE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-123 YOU CAN REDISTRIBUTE IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-124 THEY CAN DRAW A PICTURE OF IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-125 THEY CAN FIND A SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-126 THERE IS NO WAY OF EXTENDING IT FURTHER
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-127 THIS IS THE DOMAIN OF THAT SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-128 THERE IS ANOTHER SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-129 A TYPICAL SOLUTION LOOKS LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-130 THEY SHOULD SOLVE THIS BY SEPARATING VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-131 IN OTHER WORDS DON'T WRITE IT LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-132 THE SLOPE ELEMENTS LOOK LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-133 THIS IS A LINE THROUGH THE ORIGIN
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-134 HE WANTS TO PUT THAT UP IN ORANGE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-135 THIS IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS LECTURE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-136 WE ARE NOT GOING TO CALL IT THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-137 THE COMPUTER DOESN'T MIND BUT THE HUMAN DOES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-138 YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE DIRECTION FIELD FOR YOURSELF
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-139 THIS IS THE SAME AS THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-140 THIS IS HOW HE CALCULATED THE DIRECTION FIELD
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-141 IT LOOKS BETTER IF YOU DON'T
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-142 HOW DOES HE PLUG IT INTO THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-143 HE IS TRYING TO TRANSLATE WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-144 I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO WRITE THAT ON THE BOARD
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-145 THIS IS A SOLUTION TO THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-146 I AM GEOMETRICALLY DRAWING AN INTEGRAL CURVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-147 THIS IS THE DIRECTION OF THE FIELD
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-148 IT HAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-149 SO THIS IS THE INTEGRAL CURVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-150 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION IN MIND
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-151 WHAT IS A SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-152 YOU FILL UP THE PLANE WITH THESE THINGS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-153 YOU DRAW A LITTLE LINE ELEMENT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-154 THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING IN HIGH SCHOOL
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-155 THIS IS SOMETHING CALLED A DIRECTION FIELD
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-156 THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION HAS MANY SOLUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-157 YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-158 YOU LOOK AT CERTAIN FUNCTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-159 THOSE EQUATIONS ARE THE RULES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-160 THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-161 THERE ARE NO ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-162 THIS ONE IS EASILY SOLVABLE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-163 THAT IS PRETTY SIMPLE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-164 WE CAN'T ALWAYS DO THIS VERY WELL
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-165 WE WILL ISOLATE THE DERIVATIVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-166 I THINK THAT THEY KNOW THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-167 THE BOOK HAS A VERY GOOD EXPLANATION OF THAT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-168 DIFFERENT PHYSICAL SYSTEMS MAY HAVE SIMILAR MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-169 HOWEVER THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-170 THIS DOES NOT COMPLETELY DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE SYSTEM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-171 ACOUSTIC SIGNALS ARE SPEECH OR AUDIO SIGNALS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-172 ELECTRICAL SIGNALS ARE VOLTAGES AND CURRENTS IN A CIRCUIT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-173 SIGNALS ARE FUNCTIONS OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-174 THIS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE STUDY OF LOGIC
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-175 THIS IS NOT A MATHEMATICAL SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-176 THEY HAVE TO WRITE IT IN THE STANDARD FORM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-177 THE THEOREM HAS NO EXCEPTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-178 IT IS NOT EXISTENCE THAT FAILS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-179 THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO THIS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-180 THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-181 THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CROSS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-182 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE LINE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-183 IT DOES WHAT IT HAS TO DO
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-184 THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-185 HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHECK THE ANSWER
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-186 THIS IS A MORE COMPLICATED EXAMPLE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-187 THE OBJECT IS IMPLIED BUT NOT STATED
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-188 IT IS NOT LIMITED BY EXCEPTIONS OR RESTRICTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-189 HE IS JUST USING THE ABSOLUTE VALUE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-190 HE IS TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-191 HE WANTED TO SHOW YOU THE MAIN PURPOSE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-192 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANY PREDICTION AT ALL
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-193 HOW DO THEY CALCULATE THE SECOND DERIVATIVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-194 THEY WOULDN'T NEED THIS ANYWAY
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-195 THERE IS JUST ONE LITTLE PROBLEM LEFT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-196 HE CAN LEARN THOSE WORDS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-197 LET'S SAY HERE WAS THE STARTING POINT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-198 THAT IS NOT AN OPTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-199 HOW CAN HE ANSWER SUCH A QUESTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-200 HE DIDN'T TELL YOU WHERE TO STOP
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-201 THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-202 HE HAS TO CALCULATE THE NEW SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-203 HE HAS TO MULTIPLY THIS BY THIS NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-204 THEY ARE STARTING TO DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-205 OTHERWISE YOU WILL FORGET IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-206 THEY HAVE TO SEE WHERE THE MISTAKES ARE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-207 THEY HAVE TO FIND THE MISTAKES
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-208 IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO BE SYSTEMATIC
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-209 HOW DO THE SOLUTIONS BEHAVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-210 THIS IS A NONTRIVIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-211 THIS IS HIS INITIAL VALUE PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-212 HE WILL USE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-213 THIS IS WHAT HE CAN TELL YOU
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-214 THAT IS THE TRIVIAL PART OF IT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-215 HOW FAR DO WE HAVE TO GO
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-216 THIS SIDE OF THE TRIANGLE HAS A DIFFERENT LENGTH
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-217 THIS IS THE OLD POINT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-218 IT IS THE VALUE OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-219 HOW DOES HE TAKE THE NEXT STEP
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-220 HE IS GOING TO DRAW A PICTURE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-221 THIS IS WHAT YOU PREFER TO SEE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-222 THE COMPUTER IS SIMPLY CALCULATING THIS POINT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-223 THE NEXT STEP OF THE PROCESS WILL CARRY YOU TO THAT PLACE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-224 YOU CAN CONTINUE WITH THAT SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-225 WHAT INFORMATION DO WE HAVE
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-226 THIS IS THE METHOD WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-227 THIS IS THE INITIAL CONDITION
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-228 THIS IS OUR FIRST ORDER PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-229 THE COMPUTER IS CALCULATING THE SOLUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071010-en12-en12-230 I THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-001 THE COMPUTER WILL GET LOST IN ETERNITY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-002 HOW DOES THE CURVE ACTUALLY LOOK
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-003 THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY COMPLICATED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-004 SHE WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE SOLUTION IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-005 THIS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FOLLOWING EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-006 THIS WILL JUST DESTROY THEIR FAITH IN THESE THINGS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-007 THEY HAVE TO CALCULATE THOSE SLOPES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-008 THEY HAVE TO DRAW ALL THOSE CURVES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-009 IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU ARE USING
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-010 HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE FUNCTION HAVE TO BE EVALUATED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-011 WHY SHOULD THEY USE ANYTHING ELSE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-012 THEY ARE GOING TO DECREASE THE ERROR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-013 THE ERROR VARIES WITH THE STEP SIZE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-014 THIS IS THE SECOND ORDER METHOD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-015 THEY MAKE A TEMPORARY CHOICE OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-016 THE COMPUTER KNOWS WHAT THAT IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-017 DOES HE HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-018 HE HAS TO GET THE RIGHT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-019 THIS IS A TEMPORARY VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-020 YOU CAN USE THIS INSTEAD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-021 THIS IS A SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-022 HE HAS TO DRAW THIS PARALLEL LINE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-023 HE IS INTERESTED IN SOLVING THOSE EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-024 THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD TRY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-025 HE IS TRYING TO IMPROVE THAT SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-026 THEY HAVE TO FIND A BETTER VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-027 THIS IS A SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-028 THEY JUST HAVE THE NEXT STEP
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-029 HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE SOLUTION IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-030 HE IS TRYING TO SWITCH FROM ONE VARIABLE TO THE OTHER
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-031 HE CAN THINK OF IT AS A GENERAL LINEAR EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-032 HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT LET'S FORGET ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-033 HOW COULD THE CONDUCTIVITY CHANGE OVER TIME
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-034 HE IS TRYING TO SOLVE THESE EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-035 IT IS THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-036 THIS IS FOR THE SAME REASON
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-037 IT IS CALLED THE DIFFUSION EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-038 THIS IS THE EXTERNAL CONCENTRATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-039 SHE CAN TRAVEL IN VARIOUS WAYS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-040 THERE ARE LESS IMPORTANT MODELS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-041 IT OCCURS IN A VARIETY OF MODELS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-042 WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-043 IT SHOULDN'T BE WRITTEN THIS WAY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-044 THIS IS A FORM WHICH HE WILL NEVER USE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-045 HOW ABOUT THE LEFT HAND SIDE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-046 THIS IS A STANDARD FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-047 THAT IS THE EQUATION THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-048 THIS IS EXTREMELY LIMITED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-049 HE WILL FIND SOME OTHER FUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-050 HE WILL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-051 THEY ARE SOLVING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-052 HE DISCOVERED THE POWER SERIES EXPANSIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-053 HE IS WELL KNOWN FOR HIS FREQUENT USE OF POWER SERIES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-054 THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE PROGRESS IN THE FIELD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-055 THE FUNCTION IS APPLIED TO THE ARGUMENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-056 SHE TRIED TO INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF A FUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-057 HE INTRODUCED SEVERAL NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-058 THE NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMPRESSIVE NUMBER OF TOPICS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-059 MANY OF HIS WORKS ARE OF FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-060 HIS IMPORTANCE IN THE HISTORY CANNOT BE OVERSTATED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-061 HE WORKED IN ALMOST ALL AREAS OF MATHEMATICS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-062 HE INTRODUCED MUCH OF THE MATHEMATICAL TERMINOLOGY AND NOTATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-063 HE MADE IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES IN SEVERAL FIELDS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-064 THIS IS THE FINAL EXAM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-065 THE RELATIVITY THEORY IS TOO ABSTRACT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-066 THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-067 THEY HAVE BEEN CHARGED TO THE SAME POLARITY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-068 SO LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THE TRANSITION IS MADE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-069 I AM GOING TO LOOK AT THIS PART
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-070 THEY HAVE TO WRITE THE MATRIX FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-071 THEY ARE SHARING THESE RESOURCES AS A SERVICE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-072 SUPPLEMENTARY RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-073 THIS IS THE SQUARE ROOT OF MINUS ONE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-074 HE WILL COME BACK TO THIS NEXT WEEK
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-075 HE IS MAKING THIS A DUMMY VARIABLE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-076 THIS IS DONE IN THE VERY FIRST SECTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-077 HE CAN PUT IT ON THE OUTSIDE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-078 SHE WILL WRITE IT IN THE COMPACT FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-079 IT HAS TO BE COMPATIBLE ON BOTH SIDES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-080 THEY HAVE TO PUT IT INTO THE POSITION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-081 THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURE MODEL
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-082 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-083 WHY DON'T THEY CONCENTRATE ON THE MOST INTERESTING CASE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-084 THEY CAN DO THIS IN GENERAL
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-085 WE CAN COMPLETE THE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-086 HE WANTS TO MAKE IT A BIT MORE OF A PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-087 THEY FOUND THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-088 MULTIPLY BOTH SIDES BY THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-089 THEY ARE DOING JUST ONE RESEARCH
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-090 THIS IS THE FORMULA FOR THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-091 HE THINKS IT WILL BE BETTER TO SUMMARIZE THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-092 WE CAN SOLVE THAT BUT PLEASE DON'T FORGET THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-093 THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO DO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-094 DO YOU SEE HOW REASONABLE THAT IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-095 HE IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-096 HE THINKS IT IS THE BEST
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-097 SHE WORKS VERY ACCURATELY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-098 SHE IS PERFORMING AND ACTING WITH CARE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-099 HE IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING A CORRECT READING
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-100 THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND A SUBSET OF THE ORIGINAL VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-101 A PHYSICAL SYSTEM EXISTS IN THREE DIMENSIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-102 IT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO FEATURE EXTRACTION AND FEATURE SELECTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-103 IT IS THE PROCESS OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF RANDOM VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-104 IT WILL EXTRACT THE RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THE INPUT DATA
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-105 THIS IS A POSITIVE CHARGE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-106 THESE BOUNDARIES ARE GROUNDED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-107 WE CAN MEASURE THE CHARGE ON THE GROUND PLANE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-108 IT HAS THE SAME POTENTIAL AS THE SOURCE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-109 HE PERFORMED A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-110 THE ELECTRIC CURRENT PRODUCES A MAGNETIC FIELD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-111 IT CONFIRMED A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-112 HE IS GOING TO PUT THIS INTO THE EXPONENT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-113 THAT IS READY TO BE INTEGRATED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-114 HE HAS TO PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-115 THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-116 THEY CAN SOLVE THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-117 THEY ARE GOING TO USE IT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-118 WHAT IS THE SLOPE OF THE WHOLE PATH
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-119 THIS ANGLE WILL BE RELATED TO THE SLOPE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-120 LET'S INTRODUCE A COORDINATE SYSTEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-121 THIS IS A PROBLEM IN DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-122 WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DO THEY HAVE ABOUT THE FUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-123 THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE A CURVE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-124 WHAT IS THE PATH OF THE BOAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-125 HE HAS TO DRAW THE BEAM A LITTLE LESS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-126 THEY HAVE TO SEPARATE THE VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-127 THIS WILL BE SOLVED BY AN EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-128 THIS EQUATION CAN BE SOLVED
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-129 HE HAS TURNED THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-130 SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-131 FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-132 THEY ARE TRYING TO DO A DIRECT SUBSTITUTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-133 IT IS NOT OBVIOUS WHAT TO DO AT THAT POINT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-134 WHY WOULD SHE BE TALKING ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-135 THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-136 THEY HAVE THE SAME COMMON SOURCE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-137 THIS IS THE RIGHT WORD TO DESCRIBE THEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-138 HE WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO THE SECOND METHOD
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-139 SHE IS STARTING FROM THIS FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-140 HE HAS TO TURN THIS EXPRESSION UPSIDE DOWN
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-141 IT WASN'T THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-142 THIS IS THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-143 HE IS NOT SURE WHAT HE GETS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-144 THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE ASKED TO SOLVE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-145 LET'S PUT THAT IN STANDARD FORM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-146 SO THIS IS ONE DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-147 THEY HAVE TO ILLUSTRATE THE FACT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-148 THEY HAVE FOUND A DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-149 THIS IS A CONSTANT FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-150 WHAT IS THE DERIVATIVE OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-151 THIS IS WHY THEY ARE DOING THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-152 THE EQUATION IS UNSOLVABLE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-153 THEY FOUGHT WITH EACH OTHER
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-154 LET'S ASSUME THAT IT IS NOT ZERO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-155 WHAT KIND OF EQUATION WOULD THIS BE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-156 THIS IS THE FIRST THING THAT HE WANTS TO DO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-157 SHE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-158 HE HAS TO START WITH THE DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-159 HE WANTS TO DO THIS KIND OF INTEGRAL
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-160 HE DID THE INVERSE SUBSTITUTION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-161 THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF SUBSTITUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-162 THERE IS ONE LESS CONSTANT IN THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-163 HE HAS TO INDICATE THAT IT IS THE SAME EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-164 HE CAN DIVIDE BOTH NUMBERS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-165 IT IS DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-166 HOW SHOULD I SCALE THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-167 THIS IS WHAT THEY CAN DO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-168 THIS IS A BIG TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-169 THIS IS THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-170 THIS APPLIES AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-171 YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE COORDINATE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-172 THOSE ARE THE EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-173 WHAT DOES THE VARIABLE ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-174 THIS IS THE KIND OF EQUATION I AM TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-175 I WILL GIVE YOU SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT EXAMPLES OF THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-176 THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO KINDS OF EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-177 HE KNOWS HOW TO SOLVE TWO KINDS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-178 WE ARE GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-179 THE DETERMINANT IS NOT ZERO
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-180 THEY CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE MATRIX
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-181 MAYBE EVEN NOW WE CAN SAY THAT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-182 THEY CAN SOLVE THOSE EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-183 THAT IS ANOTHER KEY PROPERTY
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-184 WHAT ARE THEIR PROPERTIES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-185 THIS IS ANOTHER WORD FOR INVERTIBLE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-186 TELL ME SOME FACTS ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-187 THE FIRST LECTURE WILL BE WITHIN MINUTES
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-188 HE HAS TO GIVE SOMETHING TO THEM
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-189 AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-190 THIS HAS THE SAME STRUCTURE
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-191 WHAT DO THEY SEE IN THAT MATRIX
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-192 THE SECOND PART IS SOLVING THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071013-en13-en13-193 HE HAS TO FIND THE EQUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-01 IT DEPENDS EXACTLY ON HOW THE TEMPERATURE VARIES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-02 SHE WILL PUT IN THE ARBITRARY CONSTANT EXPLICITLY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-03 WE NEED ONLY A SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-04 THERE IS NO NEED TO INCLUDE THE INTEGRATING CONSTANT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-05 AND WHAT IS THE RESULTING EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-06 THE NAME COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IT IS AN INTEGRAL
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-07 IT SHOWS AS A MULTIPLE IN THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-08 WHY DON'T WE CONCENTRATE ON THE CONSTANT COEFFICIENT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-09 THEY CAN DO THIS IN GENERAL
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-10 THE LEFT HAND SIDE CAN NOW BE INTEGRATED
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-100 THEY ARE DEFINITELY ALLOWED TO DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-101 HE IS TRYING TO SEPARATE THE IMAGINARY PART
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-102 WHAT IS THE DERIVATIVE OF THE GENERIC VARIABLE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-103 THIS TELLS HIM WHAT HE HAS TO CHECK
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-104 THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-105 THEY HAVE TO WRITE IT THIS WAY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-106 HOW DO THEY DIFFERENTIATE SUCH A THING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-107 THIS IS A COMPLEX VALUE FUNCTION OF A REAL VARIABLE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-108 WHAT IS COMING OUT IS A COMPLEX NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-109 HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE IT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-11 I WANT TO GIVE YOU A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-110 THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-111 SHE WILL USE THE METHOD OF GROUPING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-112 THEY HAVE TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCT OF THESE TWO THINGS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-113 THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SERIES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-114 WHY IS IT SUCH A POPULAR FUNCTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-115 HE REALIZES A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-116 THIS WILL GET MORE FAMILIAR TO YOU
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-117 HE THINKS IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-118 SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT THIS DOESN'T WORK
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-119 HE HAS TO PUT DOWN THE REAL PART
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-12 YOU CAN FOLLOW YOUR NOTES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-120 IT IS DIVIDED BY A DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-121 THEY WANT TO CALCULATE THOSE NUMBERS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-122 YOU CAN ALWAYS MULTIPLY THE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-123 IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN IT USED TO BE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-124 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LOGISTIC EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-125 HOW CAN I MULTIPLY COMPLEX NUMBERS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-126 THERE ARE ALWAYS DIFFERENT ANSWERS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-127 IT IS A COMPLETELY STRAIGHTFORWARD PROCESS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-128 THIS COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE PRODUCT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-129 THAT IS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-13 THIS IS DOING WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-130 THEY WANT THE REAL PART OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-14 THAT IS GOING TO GIVE HIM PROBLEMS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-15 THEY ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-16 PLEASE INCLUDE THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-17 THEY ARE SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-18 HE DOESN'T PUT IT IN STANDARD FORM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-19 I THINK I SHOULD WARN YOU
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-20 YOU CAN FIND THE DERIVATIVE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-21 THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT SHE FORGOT SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-22 HE IS GOING TO WRITE IT THIS WAY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-23 THIS IS THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-24 WHAT IS THE FIRST THING TO DO
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-25 YOU HAVE TO FIND THE INTEGRAL FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-26 THIS IS A NEGATIVE SIGN
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-27 HE WROTE IT IN A DIFFERENT FORM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-28 THEY BETTER GET THE RIGHT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-29 YOU MUST PUT IT IN THIS FORM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-30 THIS IS THE METHOD FOR SOLVING THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-31 SO LET'S DO THAT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-32 AND THAT IS THE WAY WE SOLVE THE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-33 THIS IS AN EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL FORMULA
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-34 EVERYTHING GETS SO COMPLICATED
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-35 ALL HE WANTS IS A SINGLE VALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-36 SHE IS GOING TO DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-37 SHE WILL BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-38 THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO BE EQUAL
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-39 WHAT IS THE CONDITION THAT HE HAS TO SATISFY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-40 SEE HOW REASONABLE THAT IS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-41 HE HAS CHOSEN THEM SO CLEVERLY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-42 THIS IS THE DERIVATIVE OF SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-43 HE WANTED TO MULTIPLY THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-44 HERE IS WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-45 THIS IS THE INTEGRATING FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-46 HE HAS COLLEAGUES WHO WOULD FIGHT WITH HIM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-47 THIS IS THE WAY HE IS GOING TO DO IT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-48 THERE IS ALWAYS A TRICK INVOLVED
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-49 THEY HAVE TO LEARN THAT THIS IS AN EIGENVALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-50 IT WILL HAVE AN EIGENVALUE OF ONE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-51 THIS HAPPENS TO BE A DIFFERENT VALUE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-52 SO THAT IS WHAT IS COMING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-53 THIS WILL BE TOTALLY CONNECTED
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-54 THEY CAN SEE HOW THIS WORKS JUST BY LOOKING AT THIS PICTURE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-55 THIS IS A STABLE CRITICAL POINT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-56 IT IS JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOVE ZERO
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-57 THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRANSLATIONS OF EACH OTHER
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-58 THEY ARE INCREASING IN BETWEEN THE TWO CURVES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-59 HOW DO THESE OTHER SOLUTIONS LOOK LIKE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-60 HE IS GOING TO MAKE THAT SAME ANALYSIS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-61 THOSE ARE POSITIVE NUMBERS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-62 THERE ARE HIS THREE CRITICAL POINTS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-63 THEY TRY TO GET THE BASIC INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-64 HE WAS GOING TO WRITE IT ON THE BOARD FOR THEM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-65 HE HAS TO USE THOSE FRACTIONS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-66 THIS IS THE SIMPLE POPULATION GROWTH
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-67 HE IS TRYING TO GET USED TO THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-68 THIS EQUATION DESCRIBES HOW POPULATION INCREASES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-69 THIS IS A POPULAR EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-70 HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE TIME FOR THEM
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-71 IT IS STILL GOING TO DECREASE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-72 HE ONLY HAS TO DRAW TWO OF THOSE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-73 THAT REPRESENTS THE RATE OF CHANGE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-74 WHAT IS SHE GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT LINE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-75 THE INTERCEPT IS DOWN HERE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-76 HE IS GOING TO USE THE SAME TERMINOLOGY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-77 WHAT DO THE OTHER SOLUTIONS LOOK LIKE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-78 THERE IS DEFINITELY A HORIZONTAL SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-79 SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-80 THERE IS ONLY ONE CRITICAL POINT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-81 SHE WANTS TO ANALYZE THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-82 THAT IS THE WAY YOU MAKE PROGRESS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-83 THE SOLUTION WILL BE DECREASING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-84 HE IS GOING TO SHOW THEM MORE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-85 THAT REALLY LIMITS THEIR BEHAVIOR
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-86 THEY ARE DIFFERENTIATING A CONSTANT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-87 THEY ARE TRYING TO GET A LOT OF INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-88 WHY ISN'T SHE EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-89 SHE IS NOT READY TO DO THE CALCULATION
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-90 HE WOULD SKIP A COUPLE OF THESE STEPS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-91 THEY MAY HAVE SOME DOUBTS
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-92 WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING THAT
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-93 THE SAME THING IS GOING TO BE TRUE FOR THE INTEGRAL
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-94 HE CANNOT TRUST HIS MEMORY
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-95 HE IS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-96 HE WOULD LIKE TO USE IT FOR SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-97 THOSE ARE THE ABSOLUTE VALUES
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-98 HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT MAGNITUDE
ralfherzog-20071014-en14-en14-99 THIS IS THE POLAR FORM OF THE COMPLEX NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-001 HE WOULDN'T EXPECT EVERYBODY TO GET THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-002 THE DENOMINATOR IS BECOMING SMALLER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-003 THIS NUMBER DESCRIBES WHERE YOU ARE ON THE COSINE CYCLE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-004 YOU ARE BACK WHERE YOU STARTED
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-005 NOW THEY KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-006 THEY ALL KNOW WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-007 IT IS JUST THE BEST WAY TO DRAW THAT PICTURE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-008 SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE REAL PART OF THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-009 WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO OUR REAL PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-010 WHAT IS THE ANGLE GOING TO BE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-011 THE ARGUMENT TURNS INTO ITS NEGATIVE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-012 AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS IS THE ARGUMENT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-013 THIS IS THE ANGLE OF ONE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-014 THIS IS THE NUMBER HE IS INTERESTED IN
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-015 YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-016 THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-017 AFTER SHE GETS THE ANSWER SHE HAS TO MULTIPLY THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-018 SHE HAS TO SUBSTITUTE THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-019 SHE WILL TAKE THE FINAL STEP
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-020 SHE HAS TO INTEGRATE THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-021 HE IS VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-022 HE HAS TO MULTIPLY IT BY BOTH SIDES
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-023 JUST USE THE INTEGRATING FACTORS JUST DO IT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-024 I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT TO DO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-025 I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-026 THIS WILL BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-027 THAT IS THE REAL PART OF IT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-028 THAT IS A COMPLEX SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-029 HE HAS TO FIND THE COMPLEX SOLUTION TO THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-030 THE REAL FUNCTION SOLVES THE PROBLEM
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-031 THIS IS EASIER TO INTEGRATE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-032 IT IS THE WAY IT IS USUALLY DONE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-033 THEY GOT TO SOLVE THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-034 IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO REPEAT ITSELF
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-035 THIS IS A LOT OF WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO TODAY
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-036 THIS IS WHAT SHE IS INTERESTED IN
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-037 HE WILL BE STUDYING IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS OR SO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-038 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-039 THIS IS A LITTLE CALCULATION THAT HAS TO BE DONE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-040 THIS IS THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-041 THIS ASSUMES THAT THE NUMBER HAS TO BE GREATER THAN ZERO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-042 THIS ONLY MAKES SENSE IF THE NUMBER IS POSITIVE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-043 I AM TRYING TO GET RID OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-044 THERE IS NO STANDARD WAY OF DOING THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-045 THE DATE AND TIME CAN BE CALCULATED FROM THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-046 THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTY
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-047 HE CAN SHOW YOU ON MONDAY
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-048 THIS IS THE TEMPERATURE CONCENTRATION MODEL
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-049 THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE USUALLY TRYING TO CALCULATE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-050 HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER METHOD
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-051 THIS IS THE REPRESENTATION OF THIS COMPLEX NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-052 HE HAS TO FILE A REPORT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-053 YOU HAVE GOT MY FAX NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-054 THERE IS SOME PEOPLE OUTSIDE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-055 HE WON'T LET GO YOU ARE DOING GREAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-056 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-057 SO PLEASE DON'T FIRE ME FOR DOING THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-058 SHE THINKS THEY SHOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-059 WE DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO TALK
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-060 THAT IS A LOT TO REMEMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-061 CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-062 I WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THAT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-063 THIS HARDLY REQUIRES PROOF
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-064 YOU HAVE JUST WHAT YOU STARTED WITH
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-065 IT TURNS OUT THIS IS AMAZINGLY EASY TO DO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-066 WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A DIFFERENT SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-067 IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A REAL NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-068 SO THIS SOLUTION IS CALLED STABLE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-069 SO THIS IS THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-070 THE FIRST STEP IS TO FIND THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-071 WHY IS THE PARTICULAR SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-072 YOU ARE NOW OFFICIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-073 THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-074 THIS IS THE EXTERNAL FORCE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-075 THIS IS THE SOLUTION TO THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-076 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS VERY WELL
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-077 SOMETIMES THERE IS NO SUBSCRIPT AT ALL
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-078 YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-079 THIS IS THE SOLUTION WE KNOW
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-080 THEY HAVE TO REDUCE THE EQUATION
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-081 UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SINGLE NAME
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-082 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED THE OUTPUT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-083 THIS PART HAS A LOT OF NAMES
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-084 THEY HAVE TO FIND THOSE SOLUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-085 THE EQUATION IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-086 WHAT CAN WE SAY FOR SURE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-087 THAT IS SUPPOSED TO TURN OUT THE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-088 WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE EQUAL TO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-089 SHE WERE RIGHT BEFORE FRIENDS ARE SO IMPORTANT
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-090 THEY HAVE HEARD THE SPECIALS THREE TIMES

ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-093 THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-094 YOU ARE IN NO POSITION TO SAY YES OR NO
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-095 HE WILL USE ALL THE OTHER SOLUTIONS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-096 HE WILL DO ONE MORE SIMPLE EXAMPLE
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-097 YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-098 YOU CAN SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-099 I AM CALCULATING THE SECOND DERIVATIVE OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071028-en15-en15-100 HERE IS THE MAIN THING I WANT TO SHOW YOU
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-01 HE HAS TO BREAK IT INTO SEVERAL PARTS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-02 THEY HAVE TO START IN THE SAME WAY
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-03 HE IS INTERESTED IN EXPONENTIALS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-04 HE IS TRYING TO CLEAR A COUPLE OF CONFUSIONS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-05 THEY HAVE TO FIND A PARTICULAR SOLUTION
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-06 THOSE PACKAGES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED

ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-09 HE WILL NOT SPEAK A WORD
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-10 THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-11 THAT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-12 I THINK YOU DID JUST FINE
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-13 THEY HAVE THE ENTIRE CELL IN CUSTODY
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-14 WE SHOULD GET INTO THAT
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-15 WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-16 IT IS NOTHING YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-17 DOES HE HAVE ANY IDEA WHY SHE WAS CALLING HIM
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-18 DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE IN CUSTODY
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-19 SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-20 WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR FRIENDS IN THE PRESS CORPS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-21 THEY CAN AVOID A PUBLIC PANIC
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-22 SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW WHY
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-23 THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL TOMORROW
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-24 HE IS GOING TO PUT THIS ALL ON HER SHOULDERS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-25 THEY HAVE TO KEEP UP THE INTERROGATION
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-26 WHAT IS THE ONE THING THEY KNOW ABOUT THESE GUYS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-27 DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY IN THE UNITED STATES
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-28 YOU ARE THE ONE WE CAME TO SEE
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-29 THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-30 I THOUGHT YOU HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-31 I HOPE YOUR PARENTS DON'T WATCH THIS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-32 THE PRESIDENT HAD TO DELAY HIS VACATION
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-33 WILL IT BE SOON ENOUGH
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-34 SHE WORKED WITH THE PRESIDENT
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-35 WHAT WAS SHE THINKING
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-36 THIS SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-37 THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THOSE VALUES
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-38 YOU CAN USE IT TO SOLVE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-39 HE IS NOT ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING HE SAYS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-40 PERSONAL TRAGEDIES MUST BE RESPECTED
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-41 IS HE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAKS
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-42 HAS HE SEEN THE PROTESTERS ON TV

ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-45 HE CAN'T GET THE RESTRAINING ORDER
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-46 HE HAS NEVER BEEN THROUGH A HURRICANE LIKE THAT
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-47 THEY ARE LOOKING FOR AN EXIT STRATEGY

ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-50 SHE IS DOING THE RIGHT THING I AM PROUD OF HER
ralfherzog-20071107-en16-en16-51 I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-01 ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WILL EVER KNOW ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-02 WHY IS SHE DOING THIS TO HERSELF
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-03 SHE IS SUPPOSED TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-04 HE IS DEMANDING A FULL PRESIDENTIAL PARDON
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-05 MAKE SURE HE STAYS AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-06 WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-07 IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO PRODUCE RESULTS
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-08 HE IS NOT BUYING A USED CAR
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-09 CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU GET THERE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-10 HE DOESN'T TRUST THE AMBASSADOR
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-11 HE CAN'T GIVE HIM THIS INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-12 HE WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-13 AND THEY ARE PREPARED FOR AN EXCHANGE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-14 THEY HAVE TO COME WITH US

ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-18 HER DISK IS PARTITIONED IN OVER TWENTY VOLUMES
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-19 DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IS IT
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-20 THE TRANSFER DIDN'T COMPLETE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-21 DOES SHE REMEMBER THE ENCRYPTION CODES
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-22 THEY LOST A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE
ralfherzog-20071118-en17-en17-23 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE

ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-73 THEY HAVE OFFICERS SURROUNDING THE BUILDING
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-74 I DON'T THINK SHE WAS WORKING ALONE
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-75 THEY ARE ALL LOOKING FOR HIM
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-76 I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-77 SHE HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT SHE WANTS TO ACCEPT THE RISK
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-78 WHAT WOULD YOU WANT WITH ME
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-79 WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ME
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-80 I DIDN'T MEAN TO FIGHT YOU
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-81 HE IS JUST TRYING TO GET TO THE MOUNTAINS
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-82 THIRTY MINUTES IS NOT ENOUGH TIME
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-83 YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-84 WHY DO YOU WANT HER
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-85 YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-86 YOU ARE ASKING TOO MUCH
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-87 DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-88 HE IS WORRIED THAT SOMEONE IS TRYING TO MANIPULATE HIM
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-89 HE IS PLANNING SOMETHING BASED ON THE RECORDING
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-90 I AM GLAD YOU ARE OK
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-91 I NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-92 THEY WILL CATCH UP LATER
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-93 I WILL GET OUT OF YOUR WAY
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-94 HE MAY READ BETWEEN THE LINES
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-95 THEY ARE GETTING VERY AGGRESSIVE
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-96 THERE IS A SITUATION THAT REQUIRES HIS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-97 YOU STAY RIGHT BEHIND ME
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-98 SHE KNOWS HOW TO SHOOT A GUN
ralfherzog-20071123-en19-en19-99 THEY DON'T HAVE ANOTHER WAY
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-01 THEY WILL HAVE TO BUILD A CORRIDOR
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-02 I HOPE YOU ARE NOT LYING TO ME
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-03 YOU DON'T WORK FOR HIM YOU WORK FOR ME
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-04 I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-05 HE WILL DEAL WITH THIS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-06 SHE IS COMING TO SEE HIM RIGHT NOW
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-07 HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE HER ANYMORE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-08 IT LOOKS LIKE SHE HAD QUITE A DAY
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-09 SHE IS TO COME WITH HIM
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-10 HE WILL TALK TO HER
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-11 HE WON'T BE ABLE TO TRACE IT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-12 YOU NEED TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-13 YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE BUILDING
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-14 HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU NEED
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-15 SHE IS ACTING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE RECORDING IS REAL
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-16 HE IS THINKING ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-17 I WILL CALL HER AS SOON AS I GET THE CHANCE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-18 HE HAS TO STOP DOING THIS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-19 YOU HAVE GOT TO AT LEAST TELL HIM WHAT IS GOING ON
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-20 I NEED YOU TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HER
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-21 HE HAS GOT THE EVIDENCE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-22 HE HAS NO HARD EVIDENCE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-23 HE HASN'T SHARED THIS WITH THE REST OF YOU
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-24 THEY HAVE DONE A REMARKABLE JOB
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-25 HE KNOWS WHAT HE ASKED FOR
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-26 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-27 SHE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-28 HE NEEDS THEM TO BE ABLE TO TALK
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-29 I CAN'T TELL YOU MORE THAN THAT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-30 IT WAS A TRAGIC ACCIDENT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-31 THOSE FAMILIES MIGHT BE LEFT COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-32 THEY HAVE MADE SOME ARRESTS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-33 THEY WERE TRYING TO PROTECT HIM
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-34 YOU DID THE RIGHT THING
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-35 HE JUST WANTED HER TO KNOW THAT HE TOLD HIM ABOUT HER
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-36 HE HAS TO RECONSIDER
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-37 THIS MIGHT BE A FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-38 HE SHOULD START THINKING ABOUT HIS OWN REPUTATION
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-39 HE IS CALLING OFF THE ATTACK
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-40 WHAT MAKES HIM SO SURE THAT THIS IS ANY MORE REAL THAN THE RECORDING
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-41 SHE HAD NO CHOICE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-42 I CAN TALK TO HIM IF YOU WANT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-43 SHE INTRODUCED HER TO HER BROTHER
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-44 IT IS INTERFERING WITH HER WORK
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-45 SO WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-46 HE WILL GIVE HIM HIS ANSWERS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-47 HIS ANSWER IS FINAL

ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-49 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I WANT TO DO
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-50 HE WILL ASK AROUND ANYWAY
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-51 DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT THIS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-52 SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE THAN WHAT I AM TELLING YOU
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-53 SHE MIGHT FEEL DIFFERENTLY IF IT WERE HER FAMILY BEING THREATENED
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-54 ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-55 HE IS HIS ONLY CHANCE TO GET OUT OF HERE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-56 DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-57 THEY SHOULD PROBABLY GIVE HIM A MINUTE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-58 I WILL SEE YOU IN TWENTY MINUTES
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-59 SHE HAS TO GET BACK IN THE CAR
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-60 HE IS DOING THIS FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-61 SHE IS SO TIRED
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-62 SHE CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-63 IS HE GOING TO PRESS CHARGES
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-64 SHE IS GOING TO BE FINE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-65 WHERE IS SHE GOING
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-66 WHY DON'T YOU GET SOME SLEEP
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-67 HE IS AFRAID OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-68 SHE DOESN'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS RIGHT NOW
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-69 I TRIED TO CALL YOU BACK
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-70 THANKS FOR BRINGING THEM IN
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-71 IT IS A USEFUL METHOD OF TEACHING A RANGE OF CONCEPTS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-72 THE WATER IS CIRCULATING IN A NETWORK OF PIPES
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-73 THIS CAN LEAD TO SOME CONFUSION
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-74 WHICH POINT IS THE REFERENCE POINT
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-75 THE ELECTRON IS MOVING ACROSS THE VOLTAGE DIFFERENCE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-76 VOLTAGE IS A PROPERTY OF AN ELECTRIC FIELD
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-77 THIS TERM IS STILL USED IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-78 THE DIFFERENCE CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE ABILITY TO MOVE CHARGE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-79 IT TENDS TO PUSH ELECTRONS FROM ONE POINT TO THE OTHER
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-80 THIS DIFFERENCE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FORCE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-81 THIS IS KNOWN AS THE ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-82 IT CONTAINS LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF CALCIUM
ralfherzog-20071124-en20-en20-83 IT IS ALSO SOLD FOR THE SAME USE
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-01 HE HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-02 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THIS SOFTWARE ON MY COMPUTER
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-03 IT CAN PERFORM REAL TIME DECODING
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-04 IT IS A LANGUAGE INDEPENDENT PROGRAM
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-05 YOU NEED TO REGISTER TO GET THE BOOK
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-06 THIS SECTION SOUNDS INTERESTING
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-07 HE IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND OUT
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-08 THAT IS NOT WHAT HE ASKED
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-09 YOU KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-10 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-11 HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU WORKED FOR
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-12 HE HAS TO CLOSE THE DOOR
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-13 SHE CAN'T GET THROUGH TO HIM
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-14 SHE IS TRYING TO GET AWAY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-15 IT IS RIGHT TO FOLLOW THE CHAIN OF COMMAND
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-16 HE MAY NOT BE WRONG ABOUT THIS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-17 HE IS JUST TRYING TO CHANGE OUR POSITION
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-18 YOU ARE GOING TO TALK TO ME NOW
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-19 HE IS NOT A POLITICIAN
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-20 HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-21 HE CREATED A RECORDING THAT IS ABOUT THIS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-22 YOU ARE HERE FOR THE SAME REASON SHE IS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-23 THOSE EXAMPLES WILL ILLUSTRATE THE TYPICAL MANIPULATIONS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-24 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO ME
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-25 THE EXAMPLE BELOW WILL ILLUSTRATE THIS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-26 NOT EVERY HUNCH WORKS OUT
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-27 THE INFORMATION THEY ARE ABOUT TO RECEIVE IS CONFIDENTIAL
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-28 IT CAN BE REDEFINED USING THE OPTION
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-29 IT DELETES THEM WHEN WRITING OUT THE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-30 EACH INPUT SCRIPT HAS THE SAME NAME
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-31 THEY ARE DESCRIBED IN THE REFERENCE SECTION
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-32 THOSE WORDS ARE NOT IN THE MAIN DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-33 EACH SCRIPT HAS THE SAME NAME AS THE CORRESPONDING SOURCE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-34 THEY ARE DESCRIBED IN THE REFERENCE SECTION
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-35 I HAVE TO ASK YOU TO COME WITH US
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-36 IT CAN APPLY A SET OF COMMANDS TO EACH DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-37 WILL YOU PLEASE COME WITH US
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-38 THIS IS A LARGE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-39 THEY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE ERRORS IN THEM
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-40 THEY ARE ARRANGED IN ORDER OF RELIABILITY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-41 IT COPIES JUST THE FIRST PRONUNCIATION
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-42 HE GOT CAUGHT MANIPULATING FILES
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-43 THEY HAVE TO COPY THE ENTRY TO THE OUTPUT
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-44 THE BASIC OPERATION IS TO SCAN THE INPUT STREAMS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-45 EACH DICTIONARY FILE MUST HAVE ONE PRONUNCIATION PER LINE
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-46 HE NEEDS SOMETHING CONCRETE
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-47 I BELIEVE HE IS PART OF THE GROUP
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-48 THEY WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE BUILDING

ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-51 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-52 THERE WAS NOTHING SHE COULD HAVE DONE
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-53 SHE COULD HAVE STOPPED IT
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-54 THEY WILL FORM A SINGLE UNIFORM DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-55 THEY WILL ASSIST IN THE PROCESS OF DICTIONARY CONSTRUCTION
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-56 THEY WILL HAVE DIFFERING FORMATS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-57 THERE ARE SEVERAL DICTIONARIES AVAILABLE
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-58 HE WASN'T IN THE ROOM
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-59 I ONLY KNOW WHAT SHE TOLD ME
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-60 IT COULD HAVE COME FROM ANYWHERE
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-61 HE SENT HIM OUT OF THE ROOM
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-62 THIS IS ALL THAT WAS TRANSMITTED

ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-80 IT WILL JUST TAKE A MINUTE
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-81 THIS IS THE PART OF THE DICTIONARY CONSTRUCTION PROCESS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-82 HE THINKS IT IS READING IT
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-83 HE WOULD LIKE TO CALL SOMEONE ELSE TO TESTIFY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-84 NOTHING WAS OUT OF CONTROL
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-85 THINGS WERE OUT OF CONTROL
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-86 THIS IS NEVER NECESSARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-87 THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-88 I WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU LATER

ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-90 IN PRINCIPLE THIS IS NEVER NECESSARY
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-91 AND HE DIDN'T TELL HIM

ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-98 HE STILL DOESN'T HAVE PROOF
ralfherzog-20071125-en21-en21-99 HE AGREES WITH THIS INTERPRETATION
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-01 THE WORD HAS A REPEATED ENTRY
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-02 WHAT IS GOING ON HERE
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-03 THIS COMES AS A SURPRISE
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-04 THAT WORD IS RECOGNIZED
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-05 HE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-06 COULD I ASK YOU TO COME WITH ME
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-07 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-08 IT IS THE SEQUENCE OF PHONES TO BE USED
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-09 THE OUTPUT SYMBOL IS NOT SPECIFIED
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-10 HE IS UNFIT TO CONTINUE
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-11 HE IS AFRAID THAT IS THE POINT OF THE MEETING
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-12 SHE WILL BE JOINING US LATER
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-13 THEY NEED TO FIND HER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-18 THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-19 I THOUGHT I MADE MYSELF CLEAR
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-20 COULD HE COME OVER HERE FOR A SECOND
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-21 SHE IS NOT SAYING ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-22 HE IS GOING TO FIND OUT
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-23 THE DICTIONARY HAS A VERY SIMPLE FORMAT
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-24 EACH WORD IS DETERMINED FROM THE DICTIONARY
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-25 HE IS TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-26 THEY ARE GETTING HER TO THE HOSPITAL
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-27 THAT MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-28 THEY WOULD GENERATE THE FOLLOWING OUTPUT
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-29 HE IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-30 IT IS BEST TO GENERATE A LARGE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-31 SHE HAS TO FIND OUT ABOUT THOSE THINGS
ralfherzog-20071126-en22-en22-32 I STILL DON'T TRUST HER

ralfherzog-20071126-en23-en23-92 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071126-en23-en23-93 I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU
ralfherzog-20071126-en23-en23-94 THIS NETWORK WILL HAVE MANY NODES

ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-23 I HAVE ANOTHER ANNOUNCEMENT
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-24 SHE IS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOU BEING ATTRACTED TO HER

ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-39 SHE THINKS HE IS SAVING IT
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-40 IT CAN BE DRIVEN FROM THE COMMAND LINE
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-41 THE MODULES CAN BE LINKED DIRECTLY INTO APPLICATIONS
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-42 THERE ARE NEW RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-43 RESCORING CAN BE USED TO QUICKLY EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-44 THIS MODE OF OPERATION IS EXTREMELY USEFUL
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-45 THE INPUT NETWORK IS COMPILED DURING AN EARLIER RECOGNITION RUN
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-46 THIS MODE OF OPERATION CAN BE EXTREMELY USEFUL
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-47 DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-48 IT CAN ALSO BE USED IN AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-49 WHAT WOULD I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-50 THE RECOGNITION NETWORK IS COMPILED

ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-54 THE RECOGNIZER HAS BEEN CREATED
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-55 CAN I GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-56 IT IS CONTAINING THE COMPILED RECOGNITION NETWORK
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-57 THINGS COULD GET REALLY WILD
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-58 A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CONTROL IS PROVIDED
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-59 HE IS IN GOOD SHAPE
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-60 I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOUR DAY

ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-70 IT IS REALLY ALL FOR THE BEST
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-71 I COULD NEVER DO THOSE THINGS
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-72 THERE WILL BE A LARGE NUMBER OF TEST FILES
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-73 WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-74 THERE WILL BE NO MERCY
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-75 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-76 WHY WERE YOU TAKING CARE OF ME
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-77 THIS WILL BE COMPUTED ON A LARGE NUMBER OF FILES

ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-83 EACH LABEL IS COMPARED WITH THE REFERENCE TRANSCRIPTIONS
ralfherzog-20071126-en24-en24-84 THIS IS A SERIOUS BREACH OF PROTOCOL

ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-22 THE BASIC PRINCIPLE IS VERY SIMPLE
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-23 IT IS A SEQUENCE OF SYMBOLS
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-24 NO FILE NAME IS INCLUDED
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-25 IT IS SPECIFIED USING THE OPTION
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-26 THEY DO NOT INCLUDE THE SCALE FACTORS

ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-32 A FILE NAME MUST BE SYNTHESIZED
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-33 THE RECOGNITION RESULTS CAN BE SEEN
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-34 BOTH OF THE ABOVE CAN BE USED TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-35 THIS CAN BE OBTAINED BY SETTING THE SIGNAL TO A POSITIVE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-36 IT IS BEING USED AS A START CONTROL

ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-51 YOU ARE A DOUBLE AGENT
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-52 SHE NOTICED SOMETHING UNUSUAL
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-53 THIS WILL LEAD TO SMALL VALUES

ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-74 IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-75 SHE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-76 THEY OFFERED ME A JOB
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-77 THEY WANTED TO INTERVIEW ME

ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-81 THIS THING IS COMPLETELY INSANE
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-82 HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE PLANNING
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-83 YOU AND I DON'T WORK WELL TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-84 WILL YOU REMIND THEM THAT SHE COOPERATED
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-85 THEY CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A SEQUENCE
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-86 THE CLASS CONTAINS MORE THAN ONE WORD
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-87 WE ARE CALLING IT THE PROPHECY

ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-95 HE WILL REPAY THE FAVOR
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-96 OUR CONVERSATIONS WERE NEVER RECORDED
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-97 LANGUAGE MODELS ARE TO BE USED FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-98 THEY ARE EQUALLY SHARING THE BURDEN OF COST
ralfherzog-20071126-en25-en25-99 THEY COME TOGETHER TODAY TO MAKE A DECISION
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-01 HE IS BETTER LOOKING THAN ME

ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-09 THIS IS DISCUSSED LATER IN THIS SECTION
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-10 IT IS THE STORAGE SPACE THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-11 THIS IS THE CODE KEY
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-12 THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO TAKE IT
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-13 THEY WILL NOT BE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TIMES
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-14 THIS IS ALMOST WORTH THE RISK
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-15 MAYBE WE CAN CHECK IT OUT

ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-24 HE HAS DECIDED TO TAKE CARE OF HIS PROBLEM HIMSELF
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-25 PLEASE DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS WITH ANYONE
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-26 IT IS THE SET OF WORDS IN THE LANGUAGE MODEL

ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-28 HE IS WATCHING THEM CLOSELY
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-29 THINK WHAT THIS MEANS FOR HER
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-30 THE AGENCY WON'T GO AFTER IT

ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-42 SHE AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS
ralfherzog-20071126-en26-en26-43 I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU

ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-39 THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-40 THIS MAN IS HIDING SOMETHING
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-41 SO MY LIFE IS GOING TO BE IN YOUR HANDS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-42 I WILL BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-43 THEY ARE REVIEWING IT
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-44 THOSE ARE SEVERAL FILES
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-45 I WOULDN'T ALLOW THIS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-46 I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I KNOW WHERE HE IS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-47 THE BIGGEST REASON IS MY MOTHER
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-48 I CAN'T DO THAT
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-49 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-50 ARE YOU SURE SHE IS COMING BACK TONIGHT

ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-52 WE HAVE GOT TO GO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-53 HE IS GOING TO SEE A COUNSELOR
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-54 WHAT WOULD BE A GREAT THING
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-55 WE SHOULD PREPARE IN CASE THEY SHOW UP
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-56 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A SIGNAL
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-57 SHE WILL GET BACK FROM SAN FRANCISCO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-58 DO YOU THINK SHE IS IN TROUBLE
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-59 THE MODEL SIZE MIGHT BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-60 THEY CAN BE USED INSTEAD
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-61 THEY CAN BE STORED AS PART OF THE LANGUAGE MODEL
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-62 ARE YOU WORKING FOR HIM
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-63 SHE FEELS LIKE SHE IS LOSING HER MIND
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-64 YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-65 I KNOW YOUR FATHER
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-66 THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-67 THEY ARE ABLE TO GET AWAY
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-68 SHE DOESN'T SEE ANY GUARDS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-69 HE HAS SPOKEN TO HIS FRIENDS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-70 YOU CAN TALK TO ME
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-71 YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-72 I BELIEVE THIS ISN'T GOODBYE
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-73 WE WOULD CERTAINLY GET THOSE VALUES
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-74 YOU HAVE TO FIND THE COMMON FACTOR
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-75 THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-76 IT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE PRESSURE
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-77 I WAS WORKING WITH THESE PEOPLE
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-78 IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-79 THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-80 WHAT IS THE MATTER
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-81 THEY HAVE GOT TO RUN
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-82 WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR MOTHER
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-83 THEY WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-84 THE LANGUAGE MODEL CAN BE BUILT IN SEVERAL STEPS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-85 THIS GENERATES THE REQUIRED LANGUAGE MODEL
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-86 YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME THE SOCIAL NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-87 I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN DO THIS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-88 THE TOOL CAN USE A CLASS MAP
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-89 HE IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THEM
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-90 HE FINDS ME USEFUL IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-91 HERE IS MY QUESTION
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-92 I THINK HE IS IN TROUBLE
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-93 HE WANTS US TO GET IT
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-94 IS THERE SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-95 WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-96 WHY DON'T YOU THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-97 JUST THINK ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-98 ANY WORD CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH A CLASS
ralfherzog-20071201-en27-en27-99 THIS IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF A MORE GENERAL MECHANISM
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-01 THE NEXT STAGE IN THE PROCESS IS TO DEFINE THE VOCABULARY
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-02 YOU WOULD BE PUTTING ALL OF THAT AT RISK
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-03 YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT HIM
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-04 YOU CANNOT TELL HIM THE TRUTH
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-05 YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-06 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT THIS
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-07 THIS THING IS ON A REMOTE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-08 THEY WILL BE BUILT FROM SCRATCH
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-09 THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-10 COULD YOU DO SOMETHING WITH THIS
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-11 THEY HAVE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-12 I WILL BE RIGHT THERE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-13 THE MAIN STEPS OF THIS PROCEDURE ARE ILLUSTRATED
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-14 THE RESULTING LANGUAGE MODEL IS READY FOR USE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-15 HE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO REPRESENT THE AGENCY
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-16 HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT SO FAR
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-17 THEY WON'T HAVE TIME TO SWITCH
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-18 THIS WILL ACT AS A MICROPHONE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-19 THEY WILL SCAN FOR LISTENING DEVICES
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-20 THEY WOULD LIKE TO PLAY THE GAME
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-21 WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-22 WE DON'T KNOW YET
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-23 I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED YOU
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-24 I WANT TO REPORT HIM
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-25 THIS BRINGS ME BACK TO THE SAME CONCLUSION
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-26 THIS IS WHAT I AM THINKING
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-27 DO YOU HAVE A COPY OF THIS
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-28 I COULD MICROWAVE IT
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-29 THE FILE IS GENERATED IN THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-30 THAT IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-31 SHE SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-32 YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE MARKET
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-33 THE TRAFFIC WAS TERRIBLE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-34 YOU WILL LISTEN TO HIM
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-35 SHE BLAMES ME FOR EVERYTHING
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-36 SHE SAID SOME HORRIBLE THINGS TO THEM
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-37 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-38 HOW DID YOU GET THIS PHONE NUMBER
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-39 I AM AFRAID WE HAVE TO STOP NOW
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-40 I WAS HERE A LONG TIME AGO
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-41 THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO AWAY
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-42 DON'T FORGET THOSE THINGS
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-43 HE IS TAKING CARE OF IT
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-44 I AM GLAD TO BE HOME
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-45 I CONTACTED YOUR FATHER
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-46 THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD HAVE SURVIVED
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-47 EVERYTHING TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-48 YOU CAN SET THIS TO WHATEVER YOU LIKE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-49 THE SEQUENCE NUMBER WILL INCREASE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-50 HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-51 IT WILL BE REJECTED
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-52 WE WILL TALK WHEN YOU GET BACK

ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-60 WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH ME
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-61 IT IS WORTH THE RISK
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-62 YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE CONTAINMENT
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-63 THIS IS SOMETHING ONLY TIME CAN PROVIDE
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-64 DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO CRY
ralfherzog-20071205-en28-en28-65 SHE IS VERY BUSY WITH HER MOTHER

ralfherzog-20071205-en29-en29-11 HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL
ralfherzog-20071205-en29-en29-12 GIVING THE BEATING OR TAKING IT
ralfherzog-20071205-en29-en29-13 HE WANTS TO DIRECT HIS POWER AGAINST THE PEOPLE THAT DESERVE IT
ralfherzog-20071205-en29-en29-14 THEY HAVE TO TREAT HIM
ralfherzog-20071205-en29-en29-15 THAT SEEMS LIKE YEARS AGO
ralfherzog-20071205-en29-en29-16 ARE YOU STILL TAKING YOUR MEDICATION

ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-35 I DON'T THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-36 THE OPTION SHOULD BE USED

ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-52 THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-53 HE APPLIED FOR PART TIME
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-54 I WILL GIVE YOU A LIFT
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-55 THE TOOLS WILL NOT WORK
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-56 HE WAS RAISED BY YOUR PARENTS

ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-68 DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-69 THE LANGUAGE MODELING TOOLS CAN DETECT FILE FORMATS
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-70 THEY ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE STATION

ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-88 WHY DON'T YOU RESEARCH THIS
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-89 THE CLASS MODEL IS LESS SPECIFIC
ralfherzog-20071207-en32-en32-90 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NEXT

ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-14 WE DO THINGS ON MY TERMS
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-15 HE WILL CHECK OUT THE OTHER CHAMBER
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-16 WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE LOOKING FOR

ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-19 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-20 HOW ARE YOU FEELING
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-21 THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HER
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-22 THEY ARE SEARCHING YOUR PROPERTY
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-23 WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HIS WIFE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-24 SHE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-25 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-26 I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-27 THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THINGS BETWEEN US
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-28 YOU MAKE IT REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO BE MAD AT YOU
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-29 THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-30 WHEN DID HE CONTACT YOU
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-31 WHAT ARE YOU LOSERS DOING
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-32 I DON'T TRUST YOUR FRIEND
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-33 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-34 IT IS THE COUNTERPART TO THE LICENSE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-35 THAT DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-36 IT CONTAINS A TOTAL OF TWENTY ENTRIES
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-37 IT HAS BEEN UPDATED TEN TIMES SINCE IT WAS CREATED
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-38 I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-39 I JUST WANT TO HELP HIM
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-40 WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE ABOUT IT

ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-42 WHAT KIND OF PROOF DO YOU HAVE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-43 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE

ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-45 HE WILL UNDERSTAND
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-46 WHAT IS STOPPING YOU
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-47 IT IS NOT JUST THE PAPER
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-48 THOSE NAMES MAY BE INTRODUCED IN FUTURE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-49 BUT HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-50 THIS IS THE NAME OF THE FIELD
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-51 THEY LOVE YOU VERY MUCH
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-52 YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-53 HE MUST WRITE HIS OWN DESTINY
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-54 WORD MAPS CAN BE DERIVED FROM A COLLECTION OF WORDS
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-55 BUT YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE THIS ROOM
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-56 YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE FIRST PART OF THE MESSAGE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-57 I'M NOT TRYING TO EXPOSE YOU
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-58 DOES ANY OF THAT LOOK FAMILIAR
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-59 I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-60 IT IS THE ONLY WAY
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-61 THIS RANGE IS CHOSEN TO FIT EXACTLY
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-62 THEY ARE JUST BEING PARANOID
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-63 WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY DID TO YOU
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-64 THIS WHOLE THING IS VERY SUSPICIOUS
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-65 THIS ISN'T MY HOME
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-66 YOU WILL SHARE YOUR SECRETS WITH ME
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-67 IF I WERE YOU I WOULD FIND OUT WHY

ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-70 WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-71 THEN YOU SHOULDN'T STOP
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-72 A CLASS IS TO BE DEFINED FOR UNKNOWN WORDS
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-73 I HEARD ABOUT THE FIRE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-74 DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-75 I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TELL ME
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-76 IT IS HARD TO SAY
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-77 GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-78 THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG

ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-93 MY FATHER DOESN'T KNOW I AM HERE
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-94 I WISH I COULD MAKE IT GO AWAY
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-95 THIS CAN RESULT IN DRAMATIC SAVINGS
ralfherzog-20071208-en33-en33-96 IT WAS NEVER A SECRET

ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-16 THE FORMAT IS OPTIMIZED FOR MEMORY USAGE
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-17 I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-18 THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-19 THEY CAN BE STORED ON DISK IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT FILE FORMATS
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-20 THE FILES ARE GENERATED BY THE TOOL

ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-62 WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS OUT
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-63 DOES THAT MAKE ME A BAD PERSON
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-64 WHAT IS ALL THIS
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-65 SHE WAS A LOT MORE LIKE YOU
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-66 THEY DON'T KNOW IF SHE WILL RECOVER

ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-71 HE IS NOT GOING TO TELL ANYONE
ralfherzog-20071209-en34-en34-72 I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE

richard-20090818-sgv-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
richard-20090818-sgv-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
richard-20090818-sgv-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
richard-20090818-sgv-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
richard-20090818-sgv-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
richard-20090818-sgv-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
richard-20090818-sgv-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
richard-20090818-sgv-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
richard-20090818-sgv-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW

richard-20090820-dec-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
richard-20090820-dec-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE

richard-20090820-hzf-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
richard-20090820-ihy-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
richard-20090820-ihy-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL

richard-20090820-ihy-b0331 HIS PARTNERS HAD STARVED AND DIED ON THE STEWART
richard-20090820-ihy-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
richard-20090820-ihy-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
richard-20090820-ihy-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
richard-20090820-msf-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL

richard-20090820-msf-a0258 SOAKED IN SEAWATER THEY OFFSET THE HEAT RAYS
richard-20090820-msf-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
richard-20090820-msf-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
richard-20090820-nfp-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
richard-20090820-nfp-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
richard-20090820-nfp-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
richard-20090820-nfp-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
richard-20090820-nfp-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
richard-20090820-nfp-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
richard-20090820-nfp-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
richard-20090820-nfp-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
richard-20090820-nfp-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
richard-20090820-nfp-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
richard-20090820-omz-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
richard-20090820-omz-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
richard-20090820-omz-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
richard-20090820-omz-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
richard-20090820-omz-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
richard-20090820-omz-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
richard-20090820-omz-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
richard-20090820-omz-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
richard-20090820-omz-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
richard-20090820-omz-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
richard-20090820-poa-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
richard-20090820-poa-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS

richard-20090820-poa-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
richard-20090820-poa-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
richard-20090820-poa-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
richard-20090820-poa-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB

richard-20090820-qse-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
richard-20090820-qse-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
richard-20090820-qse-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
richard-20090820-qse-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
richard-20090820-qse-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
richard-20090820-qse-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
richard-20090820-qse-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
richard-20090820-qse-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD

richard-20090820-wjl-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
richard-20090820-wjl-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
richard-20090820-wjl-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
richard-20090820-wjl-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
richard-20090820-wjl-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
richard-20090820-wjl-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
richard-20090820-wjl-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
richard-20090820-wjl-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
richard-20090820-wjl-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
richard-20090820-yqo-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
richard-20090820-yqo-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
richard-20090820-yqo-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
richard-20090820-yqo-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
richard-20090820-yqo-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
richard-20090820-yqo-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
richard-20090820-yqo-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
richard-20090820-yqo-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
richard-20090820-yqo-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
richard-20090820-yqo-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
richard-20090821-kom-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
richard-20090821-kom-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
richard-20090821-kom-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
richard-20090821-kom-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
richard-20090821-kom-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
richard-20090821-kom-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
richard-20090821-kom-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
richard-20090821-kom-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
richard-20090821-kom-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
richard-20090821-kom-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
richard-20090828-soi-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
richard-20090828-soi-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
richard-20090828-soi-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
richard-20090828-soi-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
richard-20090828-soi-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
richard-20090828-soi-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
richard-20090828-soi-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
richard-20090828-soi-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
richard-20090828-soi-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER

rick271828-20081014-eyh-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
rick271828-20081014-eyh-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
rick271828-20081014-eyh-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
rick271828-20081014-eyh-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
rick271828-20081014-eyh-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
rick271828-20081014-eyh-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
rick271828-20081014-eyh-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF

rocketman768-20080408-ejx-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
rocketman768-20080408-ejx-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
rocketman768-20080408-ejx-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
rocketman768-20080408-ejx-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
rocketman768-20080408-ejx-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
rocketman768-20080408-ejx-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
rocketman768-20080408-hcj-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
rocketman768-20080408-hzy-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
rocketman768-20080408-iup-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
rocketman768-20080408-jrj-a0065 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
rocketman768-20080408-lrn-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
rocketman768-20080408-mdh-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
rocketman768-20080408-oey-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
rocketman768-20080408-oln-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
rocketman768-20080408-prp-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
rocketman768-20080408-pux-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0327 HE HAD BEEN SO EASY
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0328 CHANGE CHAIRS DAYLIGHT COMMANDED
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0329 I'D SOONER HAVE MY CHIPS BACK
rocketman768-20080408-ybh-b0330 THEY ONLY HAD A LITTLE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIRE
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0050 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
rocketman768-20080409-oip-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
rodarama-20100328-dfr-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0517 OUT OF ABSTRACTIONS ERNEST HAD CONJURED A VISION AND MADE THEM SEE IT
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0518 ILLUMINATING OIL WAS BECOMING ALL PROFIT
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0519 SUCH AN ACT WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0520 HE WAS FOND OF QUOTING A FRAGMENT FROM A CERTAIN POEM
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0521 WITHOUT THEM HE COULD NOT RUN HIS EMPIRE
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
roddk3-20100310-msk-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH

rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER

rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE

rortiz-20100209-omx-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED

rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR

rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS

rortiz-20121211-pta-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB

rortiz-20121211-pta-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO

rortiz-20121211-wke-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM

rortiz-20121211-wke-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL

rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME

rortiz-20121212-qak-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO

rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA

rortiz-20121212-suo-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
rortiz-20121214-ltw-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
rortiz-20121214-ltw-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
rortiz-20121214-ltw-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
rortiz-20121214-ltw-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID

rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID

rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED

rortiz-20121214-yds-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
rreeves-20110404-jyo-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
rsyh93-20120619-awv-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0006 GOD BLESS EM I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
rsyh93-20120619-vlz-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0375 THE BUTCHERS AND MEAT CUTTERS REFUSED TO HANDLE MEAT DESTINED FOR UNFAIR RESTAURANTS
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
rsyh93-20120619-wqt-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
rsyh93-20120621-gvu-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
rustushki-20080901-sos-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
rustushki-20080901-usi-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
rustushki-20080901-utf-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
rustushki-20080901-vwj-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
rwtobey-20081023-dmo-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON COMMA WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR PERIOD

rwtobey-20081023-ecg-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
rwtobey-20081023-ecg-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
rwtobey-20081023-ecg-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
rwtobey-20081023-ecg-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
rwtobey-20081023-ecg-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT

rwtobey-20081023-jiv-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE

rwtobey-20081023-jiv-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
rwtobey-20081023-jiv-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME

rwtobey-20081023-jiv-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
rwtobey-20081023-jiv-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
rwtobey-20081023-jiv-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
rwtobey-20081023-jiv-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0317 HE WAS A WISE HYENA
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO THE RED EYE'S FACE
rwtobey-20081023-lpy-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING PERIOD
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0513 HE HAD PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
rwtobey-20081023-oag-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
rwtobey-20081023-qra-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR PERIOD

rwtobey-20081023-vtw-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
rwtobey-20081023-vtw-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
rwtobey-20081023-vtw-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION

ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
ryanjyoder-20091229-uvs-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
sakurairo-20120315-pit-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
saltamontes-20080814-oal-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
sarah-20140107-klo-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
sarah-20140107-klo-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
sarah-20140107-klo-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
sarah-20140107-klo-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
sarah-20140107-klo-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
sarah-20140107-klo-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
sarah-20140107-klo-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
sarah-20140107-klo-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
sarah-20140107-klo-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
sarah-20140107-klo-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0156 FOR THAT REASON LE BEAU HAD CHOSEN HIM TO FIGHT THE BIG FIGHT
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0157 IN THE CRIB THE BABY SAT UP AND BEGAN TO PRATTLE
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0158 SHE OBEYED SHRINKING BACK WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
sarah-20140107-uoq-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
sarah-20140326-csv-b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
sarah-20140326-csv-b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
sarah-20140326-csv-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
sarah-20140326-csv-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
sarah-20140326-csv-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT

sarah-20140326-csv-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
sarah-20140326-csv-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
sarah-20140326-csv-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
sarah-20140326-csv-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
sarah-20140326-sev-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
sarah-20140326-sev-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
sarah-20140326-sev-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
sarah-20140326-sev-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
sarah-20140326-sev-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
sarah-20140326-sev-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
sarah-20140326-sev-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
sarah-20140326-sev-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR

sbf2009-20100821-wug-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
sbf2009-20100821-wug-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
sbf2009-20100821-wug-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
sbf2009-20100821-wug-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
sbf2009-20100821-wug-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
sbf2009-20100821-wug-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
sbf2009-20100821-wug-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
schultetwin1-20100709-olv-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
schultetwin1-20100709-olv-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
schultetwin1-20100709-olv-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN

schultetwin1-20100709-olv-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
schultetwin1-20100709-olv-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
schultetwin1-20100709-olv-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
scotsabe-20120910-bjs-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING

scotsabe-20120910-fey-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
scotsabe-20120910-fey-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
scotsabe-20120910-fey-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
scotsabe-20120910-fey-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
scotsabe-20120910-job-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
scotsabe-20120910-job-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
scotsabe-20120910-job-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
scotsabe-20120910-job-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
scotsabe-20120910-job-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
scotsabe-20120910-job-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
scotsabe-20120910-job-a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK

scotsabe-20120910-oqr-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
scotsabe-20120910-oqr-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
scotsabe-20120910-oqr-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
scotsabe-20120910-oqr-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
scotsabe-20120910-oqr-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
scotsabe-20120910-oqr-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
scotsabe-20120910-oqr-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
scotsabe-20120910-oqr-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP

scotsabe-20120910-pwc-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
scotsabe-20120910-pwc-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
scotsabe-20120910-pwc-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID

sfauzia-20100731-nyj-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
sfauzia-20100731-nyj-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
sfauzia-20100731-nyj-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
sfauzia-20100731-nyj-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
sfauzia-20100731-nyj-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
sfauzia-20100731-nyj-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
sfauzia-20100731-nyj-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
sfauzia-20100731-nyj-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
sfauzia-20100731-utk-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
shadowwraith-20100613-acx-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
shadowwraith-20100613-lrp-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0100 ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
sharrington-20081018-blu-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
sharrington-20081018-lmj-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
sharrington-20081018-mux-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
sharrington-20081018-ncv-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARK
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
sharrington-20081018-rgy-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED
sharrington-20081018-ucg-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0437 BY THAT ANSWER MY PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRESTIGE STOOD OR FELL
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
sharrington-20081018-uuu-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
sharrington-20081018-ygq-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT NEWS
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
sharrington-20081018-yqy-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
sharrington-20081018-zkw-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0324 NOT TILL THE TWENTIETH OF MAY DID THE RIVER BREAK
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0325 IT WAS A GIGANTIC INADEQUACY
shellemie-20121114-zmz-b0326 OUR MR HOWISON WILL CALL UPON YOU AT YOUR HOTEL
simcop2387-20080324-psl-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
simcop2387-20080324-psl-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
simcop2387-20080324-psl-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
simcop2387-20080324-psl-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES

sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-29 THEREFORE BEHIND YOUR PC GO ONLINE START MY WEB BROWSER OR VISIT MY HOME PAGE
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-30 MIGHT ALL BE VALID COMMANDS
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
sixsmith-20141016-omz-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0241 WOMEN THEY ARE CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
sixsmith-20141016-pvl-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
smarsh-20090111-cph-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
smarsh-20090111-ecy-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR

smarsh-20090111-ecy-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
smarsh-20090111-ecy-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
smarsh-20090111-ecy-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM

smarsh-20090111-rdv-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
smarsh-20090111-rdv-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
smarsh-20090111-rdv-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
smarsh-20090111-rdv-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
smarsh-20090111-rdv-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
smarsh-20090111-rdv-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
smarsh-20090111-rdv-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
smarsh-20090111-rdv-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
smarsh-20090111-uzk-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL

smarsh-20090111-uzk-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
smarsh-20090111-xlj-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
smarsh-20090111-xlj-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
smarsh-20090111-xlj-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
smarsh-20090111-xlj-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN

snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL

snblitz-20130127-kez-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM

snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING

snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT

snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
soulphox-20100119-qmd-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
soulphox-20100119-qmd-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK

soulphox-20100120-avm-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
soulphox-20100120-avm-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
soulphox-20100120-avm-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
soulphox-20100120-avm-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
soulphox-20100120-avm-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING

soulphox-20100120-bmy-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
soulphox-20100120-bmy-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME

soulphox-20100120-cqs-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
soulphox-20100120-cqs-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED

soulphox-20100120-cqs-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
soulphox-20100120-cqs-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
soulphox-20100120-dfy-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
soulphox-20100120-dfy-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
soulphox-20100120-dfy-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
soulphox-20100120-dfy-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
soulphox-20100120-dfy-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE

soulphox-20100120-dfy-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
soulphox-20100120-dkm-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS

soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
soulphox-20100120-hjj-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
soulphox-20100120-oau-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0413 HE MAY DESIRE TO ESCAPE PAIN OR TO ENJOY PLEASURE
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0414 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOIST SAIL AND CLAW OFF THAT SHORE
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0415 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR US BUT THE WIDE RAW OCEAN
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0416 I AROSE OBEDIENTLY AND WENT DOWN THE BEACH
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0417 THE NEXT THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS BED SORES
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0418 AT THAT MOMENT I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS WILLOWY
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0419 YOUR FATHER'S FIFTH COMMAND HE NODDED
soulphox-20100120-pyl-b0420 ON OCCASION ON THIS TRAVERSE THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS ARE RAISED

soulphox-20100120-tco-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
soulphox-20100120-tco-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
soulphox-20100120-tco-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
soulphox-20100120-tco-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
soulphox-20100120-tco-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
soulphox-20100120-tco-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE

soulphox-20100120-tco-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
soulphox-20100120-tco-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
soulphox-20100120-tnv-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
soulphox-20100120-tnv-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
soulphox-20100120-tnv-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
soulphox-20100120-tnv-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
soulphox-20100120-tnv-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
soulphox-20100120-tnv-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED

soulphox-20100121-axc-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
soulphox-20100121-axc-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
soulphox-20100121-axc-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
soulphox-20100121-axc-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
soulphox-20100121-axc-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
soulphox-20100121-axc-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
soulphox-20100121-axc-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
soulphox-20100121-axc-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
soulphox-20100121-axc-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN

soulphox-20100121-elr-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
soulphox-20100121-elr-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
soulphox-20100121-elr-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
soulphox-20100121-elr-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
soulphox-20100121-elr-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
soulphox-20100121-elr-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
soulphox-20100121-elr-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
soulphox-20100121-elr-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
soulphox-20100121-kcm-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
soulphox-20100121-nga-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
soulphox-20100121-skn-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
soulphox-20100126-dec-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH

starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0005 A SOIREE AT FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0006 ON THE EVENING OF THE SEVENTEENTH MARCH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0007 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY GAVE A FETE AT FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0008 OUR READERS MUST NOT AT ONCE IMAGINE A GRAND ENTERTAINMENT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0009 SUCH AS A COURT BALL OR A MUSICAL SOIREE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0010 WITH A FINE ORCHESTRA CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S RECEPTION WAS A VERY SIMPLE AFFAIR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0011 YET HE HAD SPARED NO PAINS TO GIVE IT ECLAT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0012 IN FACT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0013 THE LARGE ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR WAS COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0014 THE ROUGH WALLS CONSTRUCTED OF ROUGHLY HEWN TRUNKS OF TREES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0015 PILED UP HORIZONTALLY WERE STILL VISIBLE IT IS TRUE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0016 BUT THEIR NAKEDNESS WAS DISGUISED BY ARMS AND ARMOUR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0017 BORROWED FROM THE ARSENAL OF THE FORT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0018 AND BY AN ENGLISH TENT AT EACH CORNER OF THE ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0019 TWO LAMPS SUSPENDED BY CHAINS LIKE CHANDELIERS AND PROVIDED WITH TIN REFLECTORS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0020 RELIEVED THE GLOOMY APPEARANCE OF THE BLACKENED BEAMS OF THE CEILING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0021 AND SUFFICIENTLY ILLUMINATED THE MISTY ATMOSPHERE OF THE ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0022 THE NARROW WINDOWS SOME OF THEM MERE LOOP HOLES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0023 WERE SO ENCRUSTED WITH HOAR FROST
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0024 THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK THROUGH THEM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0025 BUT TWO OR THREE PIECES OF RED BUNTING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0026 TASTILY ARRANGED ABOUT THEM CHALLENGED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO ENTERED
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0027 THE FLOOR OF ROUGH JOISTS OF WOOD LAID PARALLEL WITH EACH OTHER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0028 HAD BEEN CAREFULLY SWEPT BY CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0029 NO SOFAS CHAIRS OR OTHER MODERN FURNITURE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0030 IMPEDED THE FREE CIRCULATION OF THE GUESTS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0031 WOODEN BENCHES HALF FIXED AGAINST THE WALLS HUGE BLOCKS OF WOOD
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0032 CUT WITH THE AXE AND TWO TABLES WITH CLUMSY LEGS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0033 WERE ALL THE APPLIANCES OF LUXURY THE SALOON COULD BOAST OF
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0034 BUT THE PARTITION WALL WITH A NARROW DOOR LEADING INTO THE NEXT ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0035 WAS DECORATED IN A STYLE ALIKE COSTLY AND PICTURESQUE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0036 FROM THE BEAMS HUNG MAGNIFICENT FURS ADMIRABLY ARRANGED
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0037 THE EQUAL OF WHICH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0038 COULD NOT BE SEEN IN THE MORE FAVOURED REGIONS OF REGENT STREET
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0039 OR THE PERSPECTIVE NEWSKI IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE FAUNA OF THE ICE BOUND NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0040 WERE HERE REPRESENTED BY THEIR FINEST SKINS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0041 THE EYE WANDERED FROM THE FURS OF WOLVES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0042 GREY BEARS POLAR BEARS OTTERS WOLVERENES BEAVERS MUSKRATS WATER POLE CATS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0043 ERMINES AND SILVER FOXES AND ABOVE THIS DISPLAY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0044 WAS AN INSCRIPTION IN BRILLIANTLY COLOURED AND ARTISTICALLY SHAPED CARDBOARD
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0045 THE MOTTO OF THE WORLD FAMOUS HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY PROPELLE CUTUM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0046 REALLY CORPORAL JOLIFFE YOU HAVE SURPASSED YOURSELF SAID CAPTAIN CRAVENTY TO HIS SUBORDINATE I THINK
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0047 I HAVE I THINK I HAVE REPLIED THE CORPORAL
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0048 BUT HONOUR TO WHOM HONOUR IS DUE MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0049 DESERVES PART OF YOUR COMMENDATION SHE ASSISTED ME IN EVERYTHING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0050 A WONDERFUL WOMAN CORPORAL HER EQUAL IS NOT TO BE FOUND CAPTAIN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0051 AN IMMENSE BRICK AND EARTHENWARE STOVE OCCUPIED THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0052 WITH A HUGE IRON PIPE PASSING FROM IT THROUGH THE CEILING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0053 AND CONDUCTING THE DENSE BLACK SMOKE INTO THE OUTER AIR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0054 THIS STOVE CONTAINED A ROARING FIRE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0055 CONSTANTLY FED WITH FRESH SHOVELFULS OF COAL BY THE STOKER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0056 AN OLD SOLDIER SPECIALLY APPOINTED TO THE SERVICE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0057 NOW AND THEN A GUST OF WIND DROVE BACK A VOLUME OF SMOKE INTO THE ROOM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0058 DIMMING THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LAMPS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0059 AND ADDING FRESH BLACKNESS TO THE BEAMS OF THE CEILING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0060 WHILST TONGUES OF FLAME SHOT FORTH FROM THE STOVE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0061 BUT THE GUESTS OF FORT RELIANCE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THIS SLIGHT INCONVENIENCE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0062 THE STOVE WARMED THEM AND THEY COULD NOT PAY TOO DEARLY FOR ITS CHEERING HEAT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0063 SO TERRIBLY COLD WAS IT OUTSIDE IN THE CUTTING NORTH WIND
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0064 THE STORM COULD BE HEARD RAGING WITHOUT THE SNOW FELL FAST
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0065 BECOMING RAPIDLY SOLID AND COATING THE ALREADY FROSTED WINDOW PANES WITH FRESH ICE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0066 THE WHISTLING WIND MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE CRANKS AND CHINKS OF THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0067 AND OCCASIONALLY THE RATTLING NOISE DROWNED EVERY OTHER SOUND
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0068 PRESENTLY AN AWFUL SILENCE ENSUED NATURE SEEMED TO BE TAKING BREATH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0069 BUT SUDDENLY THE SQUALL RECOMMENCED WITH TERRIFIC FURY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0070 THE HOUSE WAS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS THE PLANKS CRACKED
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0071 THE BEAMS GROANED A STRANGER LESS ACCUSTOMED THAN THE HABITUES OF THE FORT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0072 TO THE WAR OF THE ELEMENTS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0073 WOULD HAVE ASKED IF THE END OF THE WORLD WERE COME
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0074 BUT WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S GUESTS TROUBLED THEMSELVES LITTLE ABOUT THE WEATHER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0075 AND IF THEY HAD BEEN OUTSIDE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0076 THEY WOULD HAVE FELT NO MORE FEAR THAN THE STORMY PETRELS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0077 DISPORTING THEMSELVES IN THE MIDST OF THE TEMPEST
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0078 TWO ONLY OF THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY DID NOT BELONG TO THE ORDINARY SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0079 TWO WOMEN WHOM WE SHALL INTRODUCE WHEN WE HAVE ENUMERATED CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S OTHER GUESTS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0080 THESE WERE LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON SERGEANT LONG CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0081 AND HIS BRIGHT ACTIVE CANADIAN WIFE A CERTAIN MAC NAB AND HIS WIFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0082 BOTH SCOTCH JOHN RAE MARRIED TO AN INDIAN WOMAN OF THE COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0083 AND SOME SIXTY SOLDIERS OR EMPLOYEES OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0084 THE NEIGHBOURING FORTS ALSO FURNISHED THEIR CONTINGENT OF GUESTS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0085 FOR IN THESE REMOTE LANDS PEOPLE LOOK UPON EACH OTHER AS NEIGHBOURS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0086 ALTHOUGH THEIR HOMES MAY BE A HUNDRED MILES APART
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0087 A GOOD MANY EMPLOYEES OR TRADERS CAME FROM FORT PROVIDENCE OR FORT RESOLUTION
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0088 OF THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE DISTRICT AND EVEN FROM FORT CHIPPEWAY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0089 AND FORT LIARD FURTHER SOUTH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0090 A RARE BREAK LIKE THIS IN THE MONOTONY OF THEIR SECLUDED LIVES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0091 IN THESE HYBERBOREAN REGIONS WAS JOYFULLY WELCOMED BY ALL THE EXILES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0092 AND EVEN A FEW INDIAN CHIEFS ABOUT A DOZEN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0093 HAD ACCEPTED CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S INVITATION THEY WERE NOT HOWEVER ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR WIVES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0094 THE LUCKLESS SQUAWS BEING STILL LOOKED UPON AS LITTLE BETTER THAN SLAVES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0095 THE PRESENCE OF THESE NATIVES IS ACCOUNTED FOR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0096 BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE IN CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WITH THE TRADERS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0097 AND SUPPLY THE GREATER NUMBER OF FURS WHICH PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0098 IN EXCHANGE FOR OTHER COMMODITIES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0099 THEY ARE MOSTLY CHIPPEWAY INDIANS WELL GROWN MEN WITH HARDY CONSTITUTIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0100 THEIR COMPLEXIONS ARE OF THE PECULIAR REDDISH BLACK COLOUR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0101 ALWAYS ASCRIBED IN EUROPE TO THE EVIL SPIRITS OF FAIRYLAND
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0102 THEY WEAR VERY PICTURESQUE CLOAKS OF SKINS AND MANTLES OF FUR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0103 WITH A HEAD DROSS OF EAGLE'S FEATHERS SPREAD OUT LIKE A LADY'S FAN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0104 AND QUIVERING WITH EVERY MOTION OF THEIR THICK BLACK HAIR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0105 SUCH WAS THE COMPANY TO WHOM THE CAPTAIN WAS DOING THE HONOURS OF FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0106 THERE WAS NO DANCING FOR WANT OF MUSIC
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0107 BUT THE BUFFET ADMIRABLY SUPPLIED THE WANT OF THE HIRED MUSICIANS OF THE EUROPEAN BALLS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0108 ON THE TABLE ROSE A PYRAMIDAL PUDDING MADE BY MRS JOLIFFE'S OWN HANDS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0109 IT WAS AN IMMENSE TRUNCATED CONE COMPOSED OF FLOUR FAT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0110 REIN DEER VENISON AND MUSK BEEF THE EGGS MILK AND CITRON
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0111 PRESCRIBED IN RECIPE BOOKS WERE IT IS TRUE WANTING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0112 BUT THEIR ABSENCE WAS ATONED FOR BY ITS HUGE PROPORTIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0113 MRS JOLIFFE SERVED OUT SLICE AFTER SLICE WITH LIBERAL HANDS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0114 YET THERE REMAINED ENOUGH AND TO SPARE PILES OF SANDWICHES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0115 ALSO FIGURED ON THE TABLE IN WHICH SHIP BISCUITS TOOK THE PLACE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0116 OF THIN SLICES OF ENGLISH BREAD AND BUTTER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0117 AND DAINTY MORSELS OF CORNED BEEF THAT OF THE HAM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0118 AND STUFFED VEAL OF THE OLD WORLD
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0119 THE SHARP TEETH OF THE CHIPPEWAY INDIANS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0120 MADE SHORT WORK OF THE TOUGH BISCUITS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0121 AND FOR DRINK THERE WAS PLENTY OF WHISKY AND GIN HANDED ROUND IN LITTLE PEWTER POTS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0122 NOT TO SPEAK OF A GREAT BOWL OF PUNCH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0123 WHICH WAS TO CLOSE THE ENTERTAINMENT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0124 AND OF WHICH THE INDIANS TALKED LONG AFTERWARDS IN THEIR WIGWAMS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0125 ENDLESS WERE THE COMPLIMENTS PAID TO THE JOLIFFES THAT EVENING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0126 BUT THEY DESERVED THEM HOW ZEALOUSLY THEY WAITED ON THE GUESTS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0127 WITH WHAT EASY GRACE THEY DISTRIBUTED THE REFRESHMENTS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0128 THEY DID NOT NEED PROMPTING THEY ANTICIPATED THE WISHES OF EACH ONE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0129 THE SANDWICHES WERE SUCCEEDED BY SLICES OF THE INEXHAUSTIBLE PUDDING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0130 THE PUDDING BY GLASSES OF GIN OR WHISKY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0131 NO THANK YOU MR JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0132 YOU ARE TOO GOOD CORPORAL BUT LET ME HAVE TIME TO BREATHE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0133 MRS JOLIFFE I ASSURE YOU I CAN EAT NO MORE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0134 CORPORAL JOLIFFE I AM AT YOUR MERCY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0135 NO MORE MRS JOLIFFE NO MORE THANK YOU
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0136 SUCH WERE THE REPLIES MET WITH ON EVERY SIDE BY THE ZEALOUS PAIR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0137 BUT THEIR POWERS OF PERSUASION WERE SUCH THAT THE MOST RELUCTANT YIELDED IN THE END
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0138 THE QUANTITIES OF FOOD AND DRINK CONSUMED WERE REALLY ENORMOUS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0139 THE HUBBUB OF CONVERSATION INCREASED THE SOLDIERY AND EMPLOYEES BECAME EXCITED
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0140 HERE THE TALK WAS OF HUNTING THERE OF TRADE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0141 WHAT PLANS WERE LAID FOR NEXT SEASON
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0142 THE ENTIRE FAUNA OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0143 WOULD SCARCELY SUPPLY GAME ENOUGH FOR THESE ENTERPRISING HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0144 THEY ALREADY SAW BEARS FOXES AND MUSK OXEN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0145 FALLING BENEATH THEIR BULLETS AND POLE CATS BY HUNDREDS CAUGHT IN THEIR TRAPS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0146 THEIR IMAGINATION PICTURED THE COSTLY FURS PILED UP IN THE MAGAZINES OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0147 WHICH WAS THIS YEAR TO REALISE HITHERTO UNHEARD OF PROFITS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0148 AND WHILST THE SPIRITS THUS FREELY CIRCULATED
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0149 INFLAMED THE IMAGINATION OF THE EUROPEANS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0150 THE LARGE DOSES OF CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S FIRE WATER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0151 IMBIBED BY THE INDIANS HAD AN OPPOSITE EFFECT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0152 TOO PROUD TO SHOW ADMIRATION TOO CAUTIOUS TO MAKE PROMISES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0153 THE TACITURN CHIEFS LISTENED GRAVELY AND SILENTLY TO THE BABEL OF VOICES AROUND THEM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0154 THE CAPTAIN ENJOYING THE HURLY BURLY AND PLEASED TO SEE THE POOR PEOPLE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0155 BROUGHT BACK AS IT WERE TO THE CIVILISED WORLD

starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0162 FOR THEY WERE PRESENTLY TO GO THROUGH EXPERIENCES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0163 OF A MOST TERRIBLE NATURE WHICH NO HUMAN PERSPICACITY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE FORESEEN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0164 AMONGST OTHERS WE MUST NAME LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON SERGEANT LONG

starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0166 IN WHOSE HONOUR CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S FETE WAS GIVEN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0167 JASPAR HOBSON WAS A MAN OF FORTY YEARS OF AGE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0168 HE WAS SHORT AND SLIGHT WITH LITTLE MUSCULAR POWER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0169 BUT A FORCE OF WILL WHICH CARRIED HIM SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH ALL TRIALS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0170 AND ENABLED HIM TO RISE SUPERIOR TO ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0171 HE WAS A CHILD OF THE COMPANY HIS FATHER MAJOR HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0172 AN IRISHMAN FROM DUBLIN WHO HAD NOW BEEN DEAD FOR SOME TIME
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0173 LIVED FOR MANY YEARS AT FORT ASSINIBOIN WITH HIS WIFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0174 THERE JASPAR HOBSON WAS BORN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0175 HIS CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH WERE SPENT AT THE FOOT OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0176 HIS FATHER BROUGHT HIM UP STRICTLY AND HE BECAME A MAN IN SELF CONTROL
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0177 AND COURAGE WHILST YET A BOY IN YEARS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0178 JASPAR HOBSON WAS NO MERE HUNTER BUT A SOLDIER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0179 A BRAVE AND INTELLIGENT OFFICER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0180 DURING THE STRUGGLES IN OREGON OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0181 WITH THE RIVAL COMPANIES OF THE UNION
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0182 HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY HIS ZEAL AND INTREPIDITY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0183 AND RAPIDLY ROSE TO THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0184 HIS WELL KNOWN MERIT LED TO HIS APPOINTMENT TO
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0185 THE COMMAND OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0186 THE AIM OF WHICH WAS TO EXPLORE THE NORTHERN SHORES OF THE GREAT BEAR LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0187 AND TO FOUND A FORT ON THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0188 JASPAR HOBSON WAS TO SET OUT ON HIS JOURNEY EARLY IN APRIL
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0189 IF THE LIEUTENANT WAS THE TYPE OF A GOOD OFFICER SERGEANT LONG WAS THAT OF A GOOD SOLDIER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0190 HE WAS A MAN OF FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0191 WITH A ROUGH BEARD THAT LOOKED AS IF IT WERE MADE OF COCOA NUT FIBRE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0192 CONSTITUTIONALLY BRAVE AND DISPOSED TO OBEY RATHER THAN TO COMMAND
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0193 HE HAD NO AMBITION BUT TO OBEY THE ORDERS HE RECEIVED NEVER QUESTIONING THEM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0194 HOWEVER STRANGE THEY MIGHT APPEAR NEVER REASONING FOR HIMSELF WHEN ON DUTY FOR THE COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0195 A TRUE MACHINE IN UNIFORM BUT A PERFECT MACHINE NEVER WEARING OUT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0196 EVER ON THE MARCH YET NEVER SHOWING SIGNS OF FATIGUE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0197 PERHAPS SERGEANT LONG WAS RATHER HARD UPON HIS MEN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0198 AS HE WAS UPON HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT TOLERATE THE SLIGHTEST INFRACTION OF DISCIPLINE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0199 AND MERCILESSLY ORDERED MEN INTO CONFINEMENT FOR THE SLIGHTEST NEGLECT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0200 WHILST HE HIMSELF HAD NEVER BEEN REPRIMANDED
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0201 IN A WORD HE WAS A MAN BORN TO OBEY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0202 AND THIS SELF ANNIHILATION SUITED HIS PASSIVE TEMPERAMENT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0203 MEN SUCH AS HE ARE THE MATERIALS OF WHICH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0204 A FORMIDABLE ARMY IS FORMED THEY ARE THE ARMS OF THE SERVICE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0205 OBEYING A SINGLE HEAD IS NOT THIS THE ONLY REALLY POWERFUL ORGANISATION
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0206 THE TWO TYPES OF FABULOUS MYTHOLOGY BRIAREUS WITH A HUNDRED ARMS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0207 AND HYDRA WITH A HUNDRED HEADS WELL REPRESENT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0208 THE TWO KINDS OF ARMIES AND IN A CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0209 WHICH WOULD BE VICTORIOUS BRIAREUS WITHOUT A DOUBT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0210 WE HAVE ALREADY MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0211 HE WAS THE BUSY BEE OF THE PARTY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0212 BUT IT WAS PLEASANT TO HEAR HIM HUMMING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0213 HE WOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER MAJOR DOMO THAN A SOLDIER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0214 AND HE WAS HIMSELF AWARE OF THIS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0215 SO HE CALLED HIMSELF THE CORPORAL IN CHARGE OF DETAILS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0216 BUT HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIMSELF A HUNDRED TIMES
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0217 AMONGST THESE DETAILS HAD NOT LITTLE MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0218 GUIDED HIM WITH A FIRM HAND
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0219 SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0220 OBEYED HIS WIFE WITHOUT OWNING IT DOUBTLESS THINKING TO HIMSELF
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0221 LIKE THE PHILOSOPHER SANCHO A WOMAN'S ADVICE IS NO SUCH GREAT THING
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0222 BUT HE MUST BE A FOOL WHO DOES NOT LISTEN TO IT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0223 IT IS NOW TIME TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF THE TWO FOREIGN WOMEN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0224 ALREADY ALLUDED TO MORE THAN ONCE THEY WERE BOTH ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0225 AND ONE OF THEM WELL DESERVED TO TAKE FIRST RANK AMONGST CELEBRATED FEMALE TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0226 THE NAME OF PAULINA BARNETT THE RIVAL OF THE PFEIFFERS TINNIS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0227 AND HAIMAIRES OF HULL
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0228 HAS BEEN SEVERAL TIMES HONOURABLY MENTIONED AT THE MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0229 IN HER JOURNEYS UP THE BRAHMAPUTRA AS FAR AS THE MOUNTAINS OF TIBET
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0230 ACROSS AN UNKNOWN CORNER OF NEW HOLLAND FROM SWAN BAY TO
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0231 THE GULF OF CARPENTARIA PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0232 HAD GIVEN PROOF OF THE QUALITIES OF A GREAT TRAVELLER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0233 SHE HAD BEEN A WIDOW FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0234 AND HER PASSION FOR TRAVELLING LED HER CONSTANTLY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0235 TO EXPLORE NEW LANDS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0236 SHE WAS TALL AND HER FACE FRAMED IN LONG BRAIDS OF HAIR
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0237 ALREADY TOUCHED WITH WHITE WAS FULL OF ENERGY SHE WAS NEAR SIGHTED
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0238 AND A DOUBLE EYE GLASS RESTED UPON HER LONG STRAIGHT NOSE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0239 WITH ITS MOBILE NOSTRILS WE MUST CONFESS THAT HER WALK
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0240 WAS SOMEWHAT MASCULINE AND HER WHOLE APPEARANCE WAS SUGGESTIVE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0241 OF MORAL POWER RATHER THAN OF FEMALE GRACE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0242 SHE WAS AN ENGLISHWOMAN FROM YORKSHIRE POSSESSED OF SOME FORTUNE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0243 THE GREATER PART OF WHICH WAS EXPENDED IN ADVENTUROUS EXPEDITIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0244 AND SOME NEW SCHEME OF EXPLORATION HAD NOW BROUGHT HER TO FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0245 HAVING CROSSED THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0246 SHE WAS DOUBTLESS ANXIOUS TO PENETRATE TO THE EXTREME LIMITS OF THE HYPERBOREAN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0247 HER PRESENCE AT THE FORT WAS AN EVENT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0248 THE GOVERNOR OF THE COMPANY HAD GIVEN HER A SPECIAL LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0249 TO CAPTAIN CRAVENTY ACCORDING TO WHICH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0250 THE LATTER WAS TO DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO FORWARD THE DESIGN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0251 OF THE CELEBRATED TRAVELLER TO REACH THE BORDERS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0252 A GRAND ENTERPRISE TO FOLLOW IN THE STEPS OF HEARNE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0253 MACKENZIE RAE FRANKLIN AND OTHERS WHAT FATIGUES WHAT TRIALS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0254 WHAT DANGERS WOULD HAVE TO BE GONE THROUGH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0255 IN THE CONFLICT WITH THE TERRIBLE ELEMENTS OF THE POLAR CLIMATE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0256 HOW COULD A WOMAN DARE TO VENTURE WHERE SO MANY EXPLORERS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0257 HAVE DRAWN BACK OR PERISHED BUT THE STRANGER NOW SHUT UP
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0258 IN FORT RELIANCE WAS NO ORDINARY WOMAN SHE WAS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0259 A LAUREATE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY WE MUST ADD
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0260 THAT THE CELEBRATED TRAVELLER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A SERVANT NAMED MADGE
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0261 THIS FAITHFUL CREATURE WAS NOT MERELY A SERVANT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0262 BUT A DEVOTED AND COURAGEOUS FRIEND WHO LIVED ONLY FOR HER MISTRESS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0263 A SCOTCHWOMAN OF THE OLD TYPE WHOM A CALEB
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0264 MIGHT HAVE MARRIED WITHOUT LOSS OF DIGNITY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0265 MADGE WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0266 AND WAS TALL AND STRONGLY BUILT
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0267 THE TWO WERE ON THE MOST INTIMATE TERMS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0268 PAULINA LOOKED UPON MADGE AS AN ELDER SISTER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0269 AND MADGE TREATED PAULINA AS HER DAUGHTER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0270 IT WAS IN HONOUR OF PAULINA BARNETT THAT CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0271 WAS THIS EVENING TREATING HIS EMPLOYEES AND THE CHIPPEWAY INDIANS
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0272 IN FACT THE LADY TRAVELLER WAS TO JOIN THE EXPEDITION
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0273 OF JASPAR HOBSON FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0274 IT WAS FOR PAULINA BARNETT THAT THE LARGE SALOON OF THE FACTORY
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0275 RESOUNDED WITH JOYFUL HURRAHS AND IT WAS NO WONDER
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0276 THAT THE STOVE CONSUMED A HUNDREDWEIGHT OF COAL
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0277 ON THIS MEMORABLE EVENING FOR THE COLD OUTSIDE WAS TWENTY FOUR DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BELOW ZERO
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0278 AND FORT RELIANCE IS SITUATED IN SIXTY DEGREES FOURTY SEVEN MINUTES NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur1-fur0279 LATITUDE AT LEAST FOUR DEGREES FROM THE POLAR CIRCLE

starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0005 FROM FORT RELIANCE TO FORT ENTERPRISE THE FIRST FINE DAYS CAME AT LAST
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0006 THE GREEN CARPET OF THE HILLS BEGAN TO APPEAR HERE AND THERE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0007 WHERE THE SNOW HAD MELTED A FEW MIGRATORY BIRDS FROM THE SOUTH
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0008 SUCH AS SWANS BALD HEADED EAGLES ETC PASSED THROUGH THE WARMER AIR
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0009 THE POPLARS BIRCHES AND WILLOWS BEGAN TO BUD
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0010 AND THE REDHEADED DUCKS OF WHICH THERE ARE SO MANY SPECIES IN NORTH AMERICA
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0011 TO SKIM THE SURFACE OF THE NUMEROUS POOLS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0012 FORMED BY THE MELTED SNOW GUILLEMOTS PUFFINS AND EIDER DUCKS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0013 SOUGHT COLDER LATITUDES AND LITTLE SHREWS NO BIGGER THAN A HAZEL NUT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0014 VENTURED FROM THEIR HOLES TRACING STRANGE FIGURES ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR TINY POINTED TAILS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0015 IT WAS INTOXICATING ONCE MORE TO BREATHE THE FRESH AIR OF SPRING
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0016 AND TO BASK IN THE SUNBEAMS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0017 NATURE AWOKE ONCE MORE FROM HER HEAVY SLEEP IN THE LONG WINTER NIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0018 AND SMILED AS SHE OPENED HER EYES THE RENOVATION OF CREATION IN SPRING
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0019 IS PERHAPS MORE IMPRESSIVE IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0020 THAN IN ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE GLOBE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0021 ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREATER CONTRAST WITH WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0022 THE THAW WAS NOT HOWEVER COMPLETE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0023 THE THERMOMETER IT IS TRUE MARKED FORTY ONE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT ABOVE ZERO
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0024 BUT THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE NIGHTS KEPT THE SURFACE OF THE SNOWY PLAINS SOLID
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0025 A GOOD THING FOR THE PASSAGE OF SLEDGES OF WHICH
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0026 JASPAR HOBSON MEANT TO AVAIL HIMSELF BEFORE THE THAW BECAME COMPLETE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0027 THE ICE OF THE LAKE WAS STILL UNBROKEN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0028 DURING THE LAST MONTH SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL HUNTING EXPEDITIONS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0029 HAD BEEN MADE ACROSS THE VAST SMOOTH PLAINS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0030 WHICH WERE ALREADY FREQUENTED BY GAME
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0031 MRS BARNETT WAS ASTONISHED AT THE SKILL WITH WHICH THE MEN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0032 USED THEIR SNOW SHOES SCUDDING ALONG AT THE PACE OF A HORSE IN FULL GALLOP
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0033 FOLLOWING CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S ADVICE THE LADY HERSELF PRACTISED WALKING IN THESE CONTRIVANCES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0034 AND SHE SOON BECAME VERY EXPERT IN SLIDING OVER THE SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0035 DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS SEVERAL BANDS OF INDIANS HAD ARRIVED AT THE FORT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0036 TO EXCHANGE THE SPOILS OF THE WINTER CHASE FOR MANUFACTURED GOODS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0037 THE SEASON HAD BEEN BAD THERE WERE A GOOD MANY POLECATS AND SABLES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0038 BUT THE FURS OF BEAVERS OTTERS LYNXES ERMINES AND FOXES WERE SCARCE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0039 IT WAS THEREFORE A WISE STEP FOR THE COMPANY TO ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLORE A NEW COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0040 WHERE THE WILD ANIMALS HAD HITHERTO ESCAPED THE RAPACITY OF MAN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0041 ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTEENTH APRIL LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON AND HIS PARTY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0042 WERE READY TO START
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0043 THE ROUTE ACROSS THE KNOWN DISTRICTS BETWEEN THE SLAVE LAKE AND THAT OF THE GREAT BEAR
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0044 BEYOND THE ARCTIC CIRCLE WAS ALREADY DETERMINED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0045 JASPAR HOBSON WAS TO MAKE FOR FORT CONFIDENCE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0046 ON THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE LATTER LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0047 AND HE WAS TO REVICTUAL AT FORT ENTERPRISE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0048 A STATION TWO HUNDRED MILES FURTHER TO THE NORTH WEST ON THE SHORES OF THE SNARE LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0049 BY TRAVELLING AT THE RATE OF FIFTEEN MILES A DAY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0050 THE LIEUTENANT HOPED TO HALT THERE ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF MAY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0051 FROM THIS POINT THE EXPEDITION WAS TO TAKE THE SHORTEST ROUTE TO CAPE BATHURST
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0052 ON THE NORTH AMERICAN COAST IT WAS AGREED THAT IN A YEAR CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0053 SHOULD SEND A CONVOY WITH PROVISIONS TO CAPE BATHURST
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0054 AND THAT A DETACHMENT OF THE LIEUTENANT'S MEN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0055 WAS TO GO TO MEET THIS CONVOY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0056 TO GUIDE IT TO THE SPOT WHERE THE NEW FORT WAS TO BE ERECTED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0057 THIS PLAN WAS A GUARANTEE AGAINST ANY ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0058 AND LEFT A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR FELLOW CREATURES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0059 OPEN TO THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS VOLUNTARY COMPANIONS IN EXILE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0060 ON THE SIXTEENTH APRIL DOGS AND SLEDGES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0061 WERE AWAITING THE TRAVELLERS AT THE POSTERN GATE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0062 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY CALLED THE MEN OF THE PARTY TOGETHER
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0063 AND SAID A FEW KIND WORDS TO THEM
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0064 HE URGED THEM ABOVE ALL THINGS TO STAND BY ONE ANOTHER
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0065 IN THE PERILS THEY MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO MEET
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0066 REMINDED THEM THAT THE ENTERPRISE UPON WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO ENTER
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0067 REQUIRED SELF DENIAL AND DEVOTION AND THAT SUBMISSION TO THEIR OFFICERS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0068 WAS AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION OF SUCCESS CHEERS GREETED THE CAPTAIN'S SPEECH
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0069 THE ADIEUX WERE QUICKLY MADE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0070 AND EACH ONE TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE SLEDGE ASSIGNED TO HIM
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0071 JASPAR HOBSON AND SERGEANT LONG WENT FIRST THEN MRS PAULINA BARNETT AND MADGE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0072 THE LATTER DEXTEROUSLY WIELDING THE LONG ESQUIMAUX WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0073 TERMINATING IN A STIFF THONG THOMAS BLACK AND ONE OF THE SOLDIERS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0074 THE CANADIAN PETERSEN OCCUPIED THE THIRD SLEDGE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0075 CORPORAL AND MRS JOLIFFE BRINGING UP THE REAR
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0076 ACCORDING TO THE ORDERS OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON EACH DRIVER KEPT AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE AT THE SAME DISTANCE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0077 FROM THE PRECEDING SLEDGE SO AS TO AVOID ALL CONFUSION
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0078 A NECESSARY PRECAUTION AS A COLLISION BETWEEN TWO SLEDGES GOING AT FULL SPEED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0079 MIGHT HAVE HAD DISASTROUS RESULTS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0080 ON LEAVING FORT RELIANCE JASPAR HOBSON AT ONCE DIRECTED HIS COURSE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0081 TOWARDS THE NORTH WEST
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0082 THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE WAS TO CROSS THE LARGE RIVER CONNECTING
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0083 LAKES SLAVE AND WOLMSLEY WHICH WAS HOWEVER STILL FROZEN SO HARD
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0084 AS TO BE UNDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE VAST WHITE PLAINS AROUND
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0085 A UNIFORM CARPET OF SNOW COVERED THE WHOLE COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0086 AND THE SLEDGES DRAWN BY THEIR SWIFT TEAMS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0087 SPED RAPIDLY OVER THE FIRM SMOOTH SURFACE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0088 THE WEATHER WAS FINE BUT STILL VERY COLD THE SUN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0089 SCARCE ABOVE THE HORIZON DESCRIBED A LENGTHENED CURVE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0090 AND ITS RAYS REFLECTED ON THE SNOW GAVE MORE LIGHT THAN HEAT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0091 FORTUNATELY NOT A BREATH OF AIR STIRRED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0092 AND THIS LESSENED THE SEVERITY OF THE COLD
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0093 ALTHOUGH THE RAPID PACE OF THE SLEDGES THROUGH THE KEEN ATMOSPHERE MUST
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0094 HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ANY ONE NOT INURED TO THE RIGOUR OF A POLAR CLIMATE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0095 A GOOD BEGINNING SAID JASPAR HOBSON TO THE SERGEANT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0096 WHO SAT MOTIONLESS BESIDE HIM AS IF ROOTED TO HIS SEAT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0097 THE JOURNEY HAS COMMENCED FAVOURABLY THE SKY IS CLOUDLESS

starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0114 DURING THIS COLLOQUY BETWEEN LIEUTENANT HOBSON AND HIS SERGEANT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0115 A SLIGHT ASCENT COMPELLED THE SLEDGES TO SLACKEN SPEED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0116 AND MRS BARNETT AND MADGE ALSO EXCHANGED A FEW SENTENCES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0117 THESE TWO INTREPID WOMEN IN THEIR OTTER SKIN CAPS AND WHITE BEAR SKIN MANTLES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0118 GAZED IN ASTONISHMENT UPON THE RUGGED SCENERY AROUND THEM
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0119 AND AT THE WHITE OUTLINES OF THE HUGE GLACIERS STANDING OUT AGAINST THE HORIZON
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0120 THEY HAD ALREADY LEFT BEHIND THEM THE HILLS OF THE NORTHERN BANKS OF THE SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0121 WITH THEIR SUMMITS CROWNED WITH THE GAUNT SKELETONS OF TREES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0122 THE VAST PLAINS STRETCHED BEFORE THEM IN APPARENTLY ENDLESS SUCCESSION
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0123 THE RAPID FLIGHT AND CRIES OF A FEW BIRDS OF PASSAGE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0124 ALONE BROKE THE MONOTONY OF THE SCENE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0125 NOW AND THEN A TROOP OF SWANS WITH PLUMAGE SO WHITE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0126 THAT THE KEENEST SIGHT COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0127 WHEN THEY SETTLED ON THE GROUND ROSE INTO VIEW IN THE CLEAR BLUE ATMOSPHERE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0128 AND PURSUED THEIR JOURNEY TO THE NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0129 WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY COUNTRY EXCLAIMED MRS PAULINA BARNETT

starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0156 AND WE HAVE AS YET SEEN NONE OF THE WONDERS IT CONTAINS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0157 BUT WAIT UNTIL WE REACH THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0158 WAIT UNTIL THE WINTER SHUTS US IN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0159 WITH ITS GIGANTIC ICEBERGS AND THICK COVERING OF SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0160 WAIT TILL THE NORTHERN STORMS BREAK OVER US AND THE GLORIES OF THE AURORA BOREALIS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0161 AND OF THE SPLENDID CONSTELLATIONS OF THE POLAR SKIES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0162 ARE SPREAD OUT ABOVE OUR HEADS WAIT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0163 TILL WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE STRANGE LONG SIX MONTHS NIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0164 AND THEN INDEED YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE INFINITE VARIETY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0165 THE INFINITE BEAUTY OF OUR CREATOR'S HANDIWORK THUS SPOKE MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0166 CARRIED AWAY BY HER VIVID IMAGINATION
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0167 SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTY IN THESE DESERTED REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0168 WITH THEIR RIGOROUS CLIMATE HER ENTHUSIASM GOT THE BETTER FOR THE TIME OF HER JUDGMENT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0169 HER SYMPATHY WITH NATURE ENABLED HER TO READ THE TOUCHING POETRY OF THE ICE BOUND NORTH
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0170 THE POETRY EMBODIED IN THE SAGAS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0171 AND SUNG BY THE BARDS OF THE TIME OF OSSIAN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0172 BUT MADGE MORE MATTER OF FACT THAN HER MISTRESS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0173 DISGUISED FROM HERSELF NEITHER THE DANGERS OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0174 NOR THE SUFFERINGS INVOLVED IN WINTERING ONLY THIRTY DEGREES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0175 AT THE MOST FROM THE NORTH POLE AND INDEED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0176 THE MOST ROBUST HAD SOMETIMES SUCCUMBED TO THE FATIGUES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0177 PRIVATIONS AND MENTAL AND BODILY AGONIES ENDURED IN THIS SEVERE CLIMATE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0178 JASPAR HOBSON HAD NOT IT IS TRUE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0179 TO PRESS ON TO THE VERY HIGHEST LATITUDES OF THE GLOBE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0180 HE HAD NOT TO REACH THE POLE ITSELF
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0181 OR TO FOLLOW IN THE STEPS OF PARRY ROSS MCCLURE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0182 KEAN MORTON AND OTHERS BUT AFTER ONCE CROSSING THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0183 THERE IS LITTLE VARIATION IN THE TEMPERATURE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0184 IT DOES NOT INCREASE IN COLDNESS IN PROPORTION TO THE ELEVATION REACHED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0185 GRANTED THAT JASPAR HOBSON DID NOT THINK OF GOING BEYOND THE SEVENTIETH PARALLEL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0186 WE MUST STILL REMEMBER THAT FRANKLIN AND HIS UNFORTUNATE COMPANIONS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0187 DIED OF COLD AND HUNGER BEFORE THEY HAD PENETRATED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0188 BEYOND SIXTY EIGHT DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0189 VERY DIFFERENT WAS THE TALK IN THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0190 OCCUPIED BY MR AND MRS JOLIFFE PERHAPS THE GALLANT CORPORAL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0191 HAD TOO OFTEN DRUNK TO THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPEDITION ON STARTING
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0192 FOR STRANGE TO SAY HE WAS DISPUTING WITH HIS LITTLE WIFE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0193 YES HE WAS ACTUALLY CONTRADICTING HER WHICH NEVER HAPPENED EXCEPT UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0194 NO MRS JOLIFFE HE WAS SAYING
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0195 NO YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR A SLEDGE IS NOT MORE DIFFICULT TO GUIDE THAN A PONY CARRIAGE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0196 AND THE DEVIL TAKE ME IF I CAN'T MANAGE A TEAM OF DOGS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0197 I DON'T QUESTION YOUR SKILL REPLIED MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0198 I ONLY ASK YOU NOT TO GO SO FAST
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0199 YOU ARE IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CARAVAN NOW AND I HEAR LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0200 CALLING OUT TO YOU TO RESUME YOUR PROPER PLACE BEHIND
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0201 LET HIM CALL MRS JOLIFFE LET HIM CALL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0202 AND THE CORPORAL URGING ON HIS DOGS WITH A FRESH CUT OF THE WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0203 DASHED ALONG AT STILL GREATER SPEED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0204 TAKE CARE JOLIFFE REPEATED HIS LITTLE WIFE NOT SO FAST WE ARE GOING DOWN HILL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0205 DOWN HILL MRS JOLIFFE YOU CALL THAT DOWN HILL WHY IT'S UP HILL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0206 I TELL YOU WE ARE GOING DOWN REPEATED POOR MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0207 AND I TELL YOU WE ARE GOING UP LOOK HOW THE DOGS PULL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0208 WHOEVER WAS RIGHT THE DOGS BECAME UNEASY THE ASCENT WAS IN FACT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0209 PRETTY STEEP THE SLEDGE DASHED ALONG AT A RECKLESS PACE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0210 AND WAS ALREADY CONSIDERABLY IN ADVANCE OF THE REST OF THE PARTY
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0211 MR AND MRS JOLIFFE BUMPED UP AND DOWN EVERY INSTANT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0212 THE SURFACE OF THE SNOW BECAME MORE AND MORE UNEVEN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0213 AND THE PAIR FLUNG FIRST TO ONE SIDE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0214 AND THEN TO THE OTHER KNOCKED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0215 AND WERE HORRIBLY BRUISED AND SHAKEN
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0216 BUT THE CORPORAL WOULD LISTEN NEITHER TO THE ADVICE OF HIS WIFE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0217 NOR TO THE SHOUTS OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0218 THE LATTER SEEING THE DANGER OF THIS RECKLESS COURSE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0219 URGED ON HIS OWN ANIMALS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0220 AND THE REST OF THE CARAVAN FOLLOWED AT A RAPID PACE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0221 BUT THE CORPORAL BECAME MORE AND MORE EXCITED THE SPEED OF HIS EQUIPAGE DELIGHTED HIM
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0222 HE SHOUTED HE GESTICULATED AND FLOURISHED HIS LONG WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0223 LIKE AN ACCOMPLISHED SPORTSMAN WONDERFUL THINGS THESE WHIPS HE CRIED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0224 THE ESQUIMAUX WIELD THEM WITH UNRIVALLED SKILL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0225 BUT YOU ARE NOT AN ESQUIMAUX CRIED MRS JOLIFFE TRYING IN VAIN TO ARREST THE ARM OF HER IMPRUDENT HUSBAND
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0226 I HAVE HEARD TELL RESUMED THE CORPORAL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0227 I'VE HEARD TELL THAT THE ESQUIMAUX CAN TOUCH ANY DOG THEY LIKE IN ANY PART
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0228 THAT THEY CAN EVEN CUT OUT A BIT OF ONE OF THEIR EARS WITH THE STIFF THONG AT THE END OF THE WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0229 I AM GOING TO TRY DON'T TRY DON'T TRY JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0230 SCREAMED THE POOR LITTLE WOMAN FRIGHTENED OUT OF HER WITS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0231 DON'T BE AFRAID MRS JOLIFFE DON'T BE AFRAID
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0232 I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0233 THE FIFTH DOG ON THE RIGHT IS MISBEHAVING HIMSELF
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0234 I WILL CORRECT HIM A LITTLE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0235 BUT CORPORAL JOLIFFE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT YET ENOUGH OF AN ESQUIMAUX
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0236 TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE WHIP WITH ITS THONG FOUR FEET LONGER THAN THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0237 FOR IT UNROLLED WITH AN OMINOUS HISS
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0238 AND REBOUNDING TWISTED ITSELF ROUND CORPORAL JOLIFFE'S OWN NECK
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0239 SENDING HIS FUR CAP INTO THE AIR
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0240 PERHAPS WITH ONE OF HIS EARS IN IT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0241 AT THIS MOMENT THE DOGS FLUNG THEMSELVES ON ONE SIDE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0242 THE SLEDGE WAS OVERTURNED AND THE PAIR WERE FLUNG INTO THE SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0243 FORTUNATELY IT WAS THICK AND SOFT SO THAT THEY ESCAPED UNHURT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0244 BUT WHAT A DISGRACE FOR THE CORPORAL
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0245 HOW REPROACHFULLY HIS LITTLE WIFE LOOKED AT HIM
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0246 AND HOW STERN WAS THE REPRIMAND OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0247 THE SLEDGE WAS PICKED UP BUT IT WAS DECIDED THAT HENCEFORTH
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0248 THE REINS OF THE DOGS LIKE THOSE OF THE HOUSEHOLD
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0249 WERE TO BE IN THE HANDS OF MRS JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0250 THE CREST FALLEN CORPORAL WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0251 AND THE INTERRUPTED JOURNEY WAS RESUMED NO INCIDENT WORTH MENTIONING OCCURRED
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0252 DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN DAYS THE WEATHER CONTINUED FAVOURABLE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0253 THE COLD WAS NOT TOO SEVERE
starlite-20070613-fur5-fur0254 AND ON THE FIRST MAY THE EXPEDITION ARRIVED AT FORT ENTERPRISE

starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0004 THE FUR COUNTRY BY JULES VERNE PART ONE CHAPTER SIX
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0005 A WAPITI DUEL TWO HUNDRED MILES HAD BEEN TRAVERSED SINCE THE EXPEDITION LEFT FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0006 THE TRAVELLERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LONG TWILIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0007 PRESSED ON DAY AND NIGHT AND WERE LITERALLY OVERCOME WITH FATIGUE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0008 WHEN THEY REACHED FORT ENTERPRISE NEAR THE SHORES OF LAKE SNARE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0009 THIS FORT WAS NO MORE THAN A DEPOT OF PROVISIONS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0010 ERECTED A FEW YEARS BEFORE BY THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0011 IT SERVED AS A RESTING PLACE FOR THE MEN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0012 TAKING THE CONVOYS OF FURS FROM THE GREAT BEAR LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0013 SOME THREE HUNDRED MILES FURTHER TO THE NORTH WEST
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0014 ABOUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS FORMED THE GARRISON
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0015 THE FORT CONSISTED OF A WOODEN HOUSE SURROUNDED BY PALISADES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0016 BUT FEW AS WERE THE COMFORTS IT OFFERED LIEUTENANT HOBSON'S COMPANIONS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0017 GLADLY TOOK REFUGE IN IT AND RESTED THERE FOR TWO DAYS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0018 THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF THE ARCTIC SPRING WAS BEGINNING TO BE FELT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0019 HERE AND THERE THE SNOW HAD MELTED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0020 AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE NIGHTS WAS NO LONGER BELOW FREEZING POINT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0021 A FEW DELICATE MOSSES AND SLENDER GRASSES CLOTHED THE RUGGED GROUND WITH THEIR SOFT VERDURE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0022 AND FROM BETWEEN THE STONES PEEPED THE MOIST CALICES OF TINY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0023 ALMOST COLOURLESS FLOWERS THESE FAINT SIGNS OF REAWAKENING VEGETATION
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0024 AFTER THE LONG NIGHT OF WINTER WERE REFRESHING TO EYES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0025 WEARY OF THE MONOTONOUS WHITENESS OF THE SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0026 AND THE SCATTERED SPECIMENS OF THE FLORA OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0027 WERE WELCOMED WITH DELIGHT MRS PAULINA BARNETT AND JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0028 AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THIS LEISURE TIME TO VISIT THE SHORES OF THE LITTLE LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0029 THEY WERE BOTH STUDENTS AND ENTHUSIASTIC LOVERS OF NATURE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0030 TOGETHER THEY WANDERED AMONGST THE ICE MASSES ALREADY BEGINNING TO BREAK UP
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0031 AND THE WATERFALLS CREATED BY THE ACTION OF THE RAYS OF THE SUN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0032 THE SURFACE ITSELF OF LAKE SNARE WAS STILL INTACT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0033 NOT A CRACK DENOTED THE APPROACHING THAW
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0034 BUT IT WAS STREWN WITH THE RUINS OF MIGHTY ICEBERGS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0035 WHICH ASSUMED ALL MANNER OF PICTURESQUE FORMS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0036 AND THE BEAUTY OF WHICH WAS HEIGHTENED WHEN THE LIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0037 DIFFRACTED BY THE SHARP EDGES OF THE ICE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0038 TOUCHED THEM WITH ALL MANNER OF COLOURS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0039 ONE MIGHT HAVE FANCIED THAT A RAINBOW CRUSHED IN A POWERFUL HAND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0040 BAD BEEN FLUNG UPON THE GROUND ITS FRAGMENTS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0041 CROSSING EACH OTHER AS THEY FELL
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0042 WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SCENE EXCLAIMED MRS PAULINA BARNETT THESE PRISMATIC EFFECTS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0043 VARY AT EVERY CHANGE OF OUR POSITION
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0044 DOES IT NOT SEEM AS IF WE WERE BENDING OVER THE OPENING OF AN IMMENSE KALEIDOSCOPE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0045 OR ARE YOU ALREADY WEARY OF A SIGHT SO NEW AND INTERESTING TO ME
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0046 NO MADAM REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT ALTHOUGH I WAS BORN AND BRED ON THIS CONTINENT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0047 ITS BEAUTIES NEVER PALL UPON ME
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0048a BUT IF YOUR ENTHUSIASM IS SO GREAT WHEN YOU SEE THIS SCENERY WITH THE SUN SHINING UPON IT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0048b WHAT WILL IT BE WHEN YOU ARE PRIVILEGED TO BEHOLD
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0049 THE TERRIBLE GRANDEUR OF THE WINTER TO OWN THE TRUTH I THINK THE SUN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0050 SO MUCH THOUGHT OF IN TEMPERATE LATITUDES SPOILS MY ARCTIC HOME
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0051 INDEED EXCLAIMED MRS BARNETT SMILING AT THE LIEUTENANT'S LAST REMARK
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0052 FOR MY PART I THINK THE SUN A CAPITAL TRAVELLING COMPANION
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0053 AND I SHALL NOT BE DISPOSED TO GRUMBLE AT THE WARMTH IT GIVES

starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0055 I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO THINK IT BEST TO VISIT RUSSIA IN THE WINTER AND THE SAHARA DESERT IN THE SUMMER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0056 YOU THEN SEE THEIR PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS TO ADVANTAGE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0057 THE SUN IS A STAR OF THE TORRID AND TEMPERATE ZONES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0058 AND IS OUT OF PLACE THIRTY DEGREES FROM THE NORTH POLE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0059 THE TRUE SKY OF THIS COUNTRY IS THE PURE FRIGID SKY OF WINTER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0060 BRIGHT WITH CONSTELLATIONS AND SOMETIMES FLUSHED WITH THE GLORY OF THE AURORA BOREALIS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0061 THIS LAND IS THE LAND OF THE NIGHT NOT OF THE DAY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0062 AND YOU HAVE YET TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE DELIGHTS AND MARVELS OF THE LONG POLAR NIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0063 HAVE YOU EVER VISITED THE TEMPERATE ZONES OF EUROPE AND AMERICA
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0064 INQUIRED MRS BARNETT YES MADAM AND I ADMIRED THEM AS THEY DESERVED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0065 BUT I RETURNED HOME WITH FRESH LOVE AND ENTHUSIASM FOR MY NATIVE LAND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0066 COLD IS MY ELEMENT AND NO MERIT IS DUE TO ME FOR BRAVING IT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0067 IT HAS NO POWER OVER ME AND LIKE THE ESQUIMAUX I CAN LIVE FOR MONTHS TOGETHER IN A SNOW HUT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0068 REALLY LIEUTENANT HOBSON IT IS QUITE CHEERING TO HEAR OUR DREADED ENEMY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0069 SPOKEN OF IN SUCH TERMS

starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0078 YES MADAM BUT THE SUN WHICH YOU ADMIRE SO MUCH
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0079 WILL SOON CREATE DIFFICULTIES FOR US AND STREW OBSTACLES IN OUR PATH
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0080 WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0081 I MEAN THAT THE HEAT WILL SOON HAVE CHANGED THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0082 THAT THE MELTED ICE WILL IMPEDE THE SLIDING OF THE SLEDGES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0083 THAT THE GROUND WILL BECOME ROUGH AND UNEVEN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0084 THAT OUR PANTING DOGS WILL NO LONGER CARRY US ALONG WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0085 THAT THE RIVERS AND LAKES WILL RESUME THEIR LIQUID STATE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0086 AND THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO FORD OR GO ROUND THEM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0087 ALL THESE CHANGES MADAM DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOLAR RAYS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0088 WILL CAUSE DELAYS FATIGUE AND DANGERS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0089 THE VERY LEAST OF WHICH WILL BE THE BREAKING OF THE BRITTLE SNOW BENEATH OUR FEET
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0090 OR THE FALLING OF THE AVALANCHES FROM THE SUMMITS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0091 OF THE ICEBERGS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0092 FOR ALL THIS WE HAVE TO THANK THE GRADUAL RISE OF THE SUN HIGHER AND HIGHER ABOVE THE HORIZON
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0093 BEAR THIS IN MIND MADAM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0094 OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF THE OLD CREATION ONLY ONE IS NECESSARY TO US HERE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0095 THE AIR THE OTHER THREE FIRE EARTH AND WATER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0096 ARE DE TROP IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0097 OF COURSE THE LIEUTENANT WAS EXAGGERATING AND MRS BARNETT COULD EASILY HAVE RETORTED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0098 WITH COUNTER ARGUMENTS BUT SHE LIKED TO HEAR HIS RAPTURES IN PRAISE OF HIS BELOVED COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0099 AND SHE FELT THAT HIS ENTHUSIASM WAS A GUARANTEE THAT HE WOULD SHRINK FROM NO OBSTACLE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0100 YET JASPAR HOBSON WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THE SUN WOULD CAUSE DIFFICULTIES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0101 THIS WAS SEEN WHEN THE PARTY SET OUT AGAIN ON THE FOURTH MAY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0102 THREE DAYS LATER THE THERMOMETER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0103 EVEN IN THE COLDEST PART OF THE NIGHT MARKED MORE THAN THIRTY TWO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0104 A COMPLETE THAW SET IN THE VAST WHITE SHEET OF SNOW RESOLVED ITSELF INTO WATER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0105 THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE ROCKY SOIL CAUSED CONSTANT JOLTING OF THE SLEDGES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0106 AND THE PASSENGERS WERE ROUGHLY SHAKEN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0107 THE ROADS WERE SO HEAVY THAT THE DOGS HAD TO GO AT A SLOW TROT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0108 AND THE REINS WERE THEREFORE AGAIN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0109 ENTRUSTED TO THE HANDS OF THE IMPRUDENT CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0110 NEITHER SHOUTS NOR FLOURISHINGS OF THE WHIP
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0111 HAD THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT ON THE JADED ANIMALS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0112 FROM TIME TO TIME THE TRAVELLERS LIGHTENED THE SLEDGES BY WALKING LITTLE WAY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0113 THIS MODE OF LOCOMOTION SUITED THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0114 WHO WERE NOW GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE BEST DISTRICTS FOR GAME IN THE WHOLE OF ENGLISH AMERICA
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0115 MRS PAULINA BARNETT AND MADGE TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN THE CHASE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0116 WHILST THOMAS BLACK PROFESSED ABSOLUTE INDIFFERENCE TO ALL ATHLETIC EXERCISE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0117 HE HAD NOT COME ALL THIS DISTANCE TO HUNT THE POLECAT OR THE ERMINE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0118 BUT MERELY TO LOOK AT THE MOON
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0119 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HER DISC SHOULD COVER THAT OF THE SUN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0120 WHEN THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT ROSE ABOVE THE HORIZON THE IMPATIENT ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0121 WOULD GAZE AT HER WITH EAGER EYES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0122 AND ONE DAY THE LIEUTENANT SAID TO HIM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0123 IT WOULD BE A BAD LOOK OUT FOR YOU MR BLACK
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0124 IF BY ANY UNLUCKY CHANCE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0125 THE MOON SHOULD FAIL TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT ON THE SIXTEENTH JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0126 LIEUTENANT HOBSON GRAVELY REPLIED THE ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0127 IF THE MOON WERE GUILTY OF SUCH A BREACH OF GOOD MANNERS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0128 I SHOULD INDEED HAVE CAUSE TO COMPLAIN THE CHIEF HUNTERS OF THE EXPEDITION
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0129 WERE THE SOLDIERS MARBRE AND SABINE BOTH VERY EXPERT AT THEIR BUSINESS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0130 THEIR SKILL WAS WONDERFUL AND THE CLEVEREST INDIANS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0131 WOULD NOT HAVE SURPASSED THEM IN KEENNESS OF SIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0132 PRECISION OF AIM OR MANUAL ADDRESS THEY WERE ALIKE TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0133 AND WERE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE NETS AND SNARES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0134 FOR TAKING SABLES OTTERS WOLVES FOXES BEARS ETC
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0135 NO ARTIFICE WAS UNKNOWN TO THEM AND CAPTAIN CRAVENTY HAD SHOWN HIS WISDOM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0136 IN CHOOSING TWO SUCH INTELLIGENT MEN TO ACCOMPANY THE LITTLE TROOP
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0137 WHILST ON THE MARCH HOWEVER MARBRE AND SABINE HAD NO TIME FOR SETTING TRAPS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0138 THEY COULD NOT SEPARATE FROM THE OTHERS FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR OR TWO AT A TIME
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0139 AND WERE OBLIGED TO BE CONTENT WITH THE GAME WHICH PASSED WITHIN RANGE OF THEIR RIFLES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0140 STILL THEY WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO KILL TWO OF THE LARGE AMERICAN RUMINANTS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0141 SELDOM MET WITH IN SUCH ELEVATED LATITUDES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0142 ON THE MORNING OF THE FIFTEENTH MAY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0143 THE HUNTERS ASKED PERMISSION TO FOLLOW SOME FRESH TRACES THEY HAD FOUND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0144 AND THE LIEUTENANT NOT ONLY GRANTED IT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0145 BUT HIMSELF ACCOMPANIED THEM WITH MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0146 AND THEY WENT SEVERAL MILES OUT OF THEIR ROUTE TOWARDS THE EAST
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0147 THE IMPRESSIONS WERE EVIDENTLY THE RESULT OF THE PASSAGE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0148 OF ABOUT HALF A DOZEN LARGE DEER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0149 THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0150 MARBRE AND SABINE WERE POSITIVE ON THAT POINT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0151 AND COULD EVEN HAVE NAMED THE SPECIES TO WHICH THE ANIMALS BELONGED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0152 YOU SEEM SURPRISED TO HAVE MET WITH TRACES OF THESE ANIMALS HERE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0153 SAID MRS BARNETT WELL MADAM REPLIED HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0154 THIS SPECIES IS RARELY SEEN BEYOND FIFTY SEVEN DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0155 WE GENERALLY HUNT THEM AT THE SOUTH OF THE SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0156 WHERE THEY FEED UPON THE SHOOTS OF WILLOWS AND POPLARS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0157 AND CERTAIN WILD ROSES TO WHICH THEY ARE VERY PARTIAL
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0158 I SUPPOSE THESE CREATURES LIKE THOSE WITH VALUABLE FURS HAVE FLED FROM THE DISTRICTS SCOURED BY THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0159 I SEE NO OTHER EXPLANATION OF THEIR PRESENCE AT SIXTY FIVE DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0160 THAT IS IF THE MEN ARE NOT MISTAKEN AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE FOOTPRINTS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0161 NO NO SIR CRIED SABINE MARBRE AND I ARE NOT MISTAKEN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0162 THESE TRACES WERE LEFT BY DEER THE DEER WE HUNTERS CALL RED DEER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0163 AND THE NATIVES WAPITIS HE IS QUITE RIGHT ADDED MARBRE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0164 OLD TRAPPERS LIKE US ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN IN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0165 BESIDES DON'T YOU HEAR THAT PECULIAR WHISTLING SOUND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0166 THE PARTY HAD NOW REACHED THE FOOT OF A LITTLE HILL
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0167 AND AS THE SNOW HAD ALMOST DISAPPEARED FROM ITS SIDES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0168 THEY WERE ABLE TO CLIMB IT AND HASTENED TO THE SUMMIT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0169 THE PECULIAR WHISTLING NOTICED BY MARBRE BECOMING LOUDER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0170 MINGLED WITH CRIES RESEMBLING THE BRAYING OF AN ASS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0171 AND PROVING THAT THE TWO HUNTERS WERE RIOT MISTAKEN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0172 ONCE AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0173 THE ADVENTURERS LOOKED EAGERLY TOWARDS THE EAST
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0174 THE UNDULATING PLAINS WERE STILL WHITE WITH SNOW
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0175 BUT ITS DAZZLING SURFACE WAS HERE AND THERE RELIEVED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0176 WITH PATCHES OF STUNTED LIGHT GREEN VEGETATION
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0177 A FEW GAUNT SHRUBS STRETCHED FORTH THEIR BARE AND SHRIVELLED BRANCHES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0178 AND HUGE ICEBERGS WITH PRECIPITOUS SIDES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0179 STOOD OUT AGAINST THE GREY BACKGROUND OF THE SKY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0180 WAPITIS WAPITIS THERE THEY ARE CRIED SABINE AND MARBRE AT ONCE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0181 POINTING TO A GROUP OF ANIMALS DISTINCTLY VISIBLE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0182 ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE TO THE EAST
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0183 WHAT ARE THEY DOING ASKED MRS BARNETT THEY ARE FIGHTING MADAM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0184 REPLIED HOBSON THEY ALWAYS DO WHEN THE HEAT OF THE POLAR SUN
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0185 INFLAMES THEIR BLOOD ANOTHER DEPLORABLE RESULT OF THE ACTION OF THE RADIANT ORB OF DAY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0186 FROM WHERE THEY STOOD THE PARTY COULD EASILY WATCH THE GROUP OF WAPITIS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0187 THEY WERE FINE SPECIMENS OF THE FAMILY OF DEER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0188 KNOWN UNDER THE VARIOUS NAMES OF STAGS WITH ROUNDED ANTLERS AMERICAN STAGS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0189 ROEBUCKS GREY ELKS AND RED ELKS ETC THESE GRACEFUL CREATURES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0190 HAVE SLENDER LEGS AND BROWN SKINS WITH PATCHES OF RED HAIR
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0191 THE COLOUR OF WHICH BECOMES DARKER IN THE WARMER SEASON
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0192 THE FIERCE MALES ARE EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE FEMALES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0193 BY THEIR FINE WHITE ANTLERS THE LATTER BEING ENTIRELY WITHOUT THESE ORNAMENTS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0194 THESE WAPITIS WERE ONCE VERY NUMEROUS ALL OVER NORTH AMERICA AND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0195 THE UNITED STATES IMPORTED A GREAT MANY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0196 BUT CLEARINGS WERE BEGUN ON EVERY SIDE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0197 THE FOREST TREES FELL BENEATH THE AXE OF THE PIONEER OF CIVILISATION AND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0198 THE WAPITIS TOOK REFUGE IN THE MORE PEACEFUL DISTRICTS OF CANADA
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0199 BUT THEY WERE SOON AGAIN DISTURBED AND WANDERED TO THE SHORES OF HUDSON'S BAY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0200 SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE WAPITI THRIVES IN A COLD COUNTRY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0201 LIEUTENANT HOBSON WAS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT IT SELDOM PENETRATES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0202 BEYOND FIFTY SEVEN DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE AND THE SPECIMENS NOW FOUND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0203 HAD DOUBTLESS FLED BEFORE THE CHIPPEWAY INDIANS WHO HUNT THEM WITHOUT MERCY
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0204 THE WAPITIS WERE SO ENGROSSED IN THEIR DESPERATE STRUGGLE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0205 THAT THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE APPROACH OF THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0206 BUT THEY WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE CEASED FIGHTING HAD THEY BEEN AWARE OF IT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0207 MARBRE AND SABINE AWARE OF THEIR PECULIARITY IN THIS RESPECT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0208 MIGHT THEREFORE HAVE ADVANCED FEARLESSLY UPON THEM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0209 AND HAVE TAKEN AIM AT LEISURE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0210 LIEUTENANT HOBSON SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD DO SO BEG PARDON SIR
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0211 REPLIED MARBRE BUT LET US SPARE OUR POWDER AND SHOT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0212 THESE BEASTS ARE ENGAGED IN A WAR TO THE DEATH
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0213 AND WE SHALL ARRIVE IN PLENTY OF TIME TO PICK UP THE VANQUISHED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0214 HAVE THESE WAPITIS A COMMERCIAL VALUE ASKED MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0215 YES MADAM REPLIED HOBSON
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0216 AND THEIR SKIN WHICH IS NOT QUITE SO THICK AS THAT OF THE ELK
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0217 PROPERLY SO CALLED MAKES VERY VALUABLE LEATHER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0218 BY RUBBING THIS SKIN WITH THE FAT AND BRAINS OF THE ANIMAL ITSELF
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0219 IT IS RENDERED FLEXIBLE AND NEITHER DAMP NOR DRYNESS INJURES IT THE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0220 INDIANS ARE THEREFORE ALWAYS EAGER TO PROCURE THE SKINS OF THE WAPITIS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0221 DOES NOT THE FLESH MAKE ADMIRABLE VENISON PRETTY GOOD MADAM ONLY PRETTY GOOD
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0222 IT IS TOUGH AND DOES NOT TASTE VERY NICE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0223 THE FAT BECOMES HARD DIRECTLY IT IS TAKEN FROM THE FIRE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0224 AND STICKS TO THE TEETH IT IS CERTAINLY INFERIOR AS AN ARTICLE OF FOOD
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0225 TO THE FLESH OF OTHER DEER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0226 BUT WHEN MEAT IS SCARCE WE ARE GLAD ENOUGH TO EAT IT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0227 AND IT SUPPORTS LIFE AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0228 MRS BARNETT AND LIEUTENANT HOBSON HAD BEEN CHATTING TOGETHER FOR SOME MINUTES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0229 WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO THE WAPITIS SUDDENLY CEASED FIGHTING
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0230 WAS THEIR RAGE SATIATED OR HAD THEY PERCEIVED THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0231 AND FELT THE APPROACH OF DANGER WHATEVER THE CAUSE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0232 ALL BUT TWO FINE CREATURES FLED A TOWARDS THE EAST WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0233 IN A FEW INSTANTS THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0234 AND THE SWIFTEST HORSE COULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT THEM UP
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0235 MEANWHILE HOWEVER TWO MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS REMAINED ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0236 HEADS DOWN ANTLERS TO ANTLERS HIND LEGS STRETCHED AND QUIVERING
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0237 THEY BUTTED AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT A MOMENT'S PAUSE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0238 LIKE TWO WRESTLERS STRUGGLING FOR A PRIZE WHICH NEITHER WILL YIELD
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0239 THEY WOULD NOT SEPARATE BUT WHIRLED ROUND AND ROUND TOGETHER ON THEIR FRONT LEGS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0240 AS IF RIVETED TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT IMPLACABLE RAGE EXCLAIMED MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0241 YES REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT THE WAPITIS REALLY ARE MOST SPITEFUL BEASTS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0242 I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE FIGHTING OUT AN OLD QUARREL
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0243 WOULD NOT THIS BE THE TIME TO APPROACH THEM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0244 WHEN THEY ARE BLINDED WITH RAGE THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME MA'AM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0245 SAID SABINE THEY WON'T ESCAPE US NOW THEY WILL NOT STIR FROM WHERE THEY ARE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0246 WHEN WE ARE THREE STEPS FROM THEM THE RIFLES AT OUR SHOULDERS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0247 AND OUR FINGERS ON THE TRIGGERS INDEED YES MADAM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0248 ADDED HOBSON WHO HAD CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE WAPITIS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0249 AFTER THE HUNTER'S REMARK AND WHETHER AT OUR HANDS OR FROM THE TEETH OF WOLVES
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0250 THOSE WAPITIS WILL MEET DEATH WHERE THEY NOW STAND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0251 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN LIEUTENANT SAID MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0252 WELL GO NEARER MADAM HE REPLIED DON'T BE AFRAID OF STARTLING THE ANIMALS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0253 FOR AS OUR HUNTER SAYS THEY ARE NO LONGER CAPABLE OF FLIGHT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0254 THE FOUR NOW DESCENDED THE HILL
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0255 AND IN A FEW MINUTES GAINED THE THEATRE OF THE STRUGGLE
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0256 THE WAPITIS HAD NOT MOVED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0257 THEY WERE PUSHING AT EACH OTHER LIKE A COUPLE OF RAMS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0258 AND SEEMED TO BE INSEPARABLY GLUED TOGETHER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0259 IN FACT IN THE HEAT OF THE COMBAT
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0260 THE ANTLERS OF THE TWO CREATURES HAD BECOME ENTANGLED TOGETHER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0261 TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER SEPARATE WITHOUT BREAKING THEM
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0262 THIS OFTEN HAPPENS IN THE HUNTING DISTRICTS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0263 IT IS NOT AT ALL UNCOMMON TO FIND ANTLERS THUS CONNECTED LYING ON THE GROUND
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0264 THE POOR ENCUMBERED ANIMALS SOON DIE OF HUNGER
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0265 OR THEY BECOME AN EASY PREY TO WILD BEASTS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0266 TWO BULLETS PUT AN END TO THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE WAPITIS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0267 AND MARBRE AND SABINE TAKING IMMEDIATE POSSESSION
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0268 CARRIED OFF THEIR SKINS TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY PREPARED
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0269 LEAVING THEIR BLEEDING CARCASSES TO BE DEVOURED BY WOLVES AND BEARS
starlite-20070613-fur6-fur0270 END OF CHAPTER SIX

starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0004 THE FUR COUNTRY BY JULES VERNE PART ONE CHAPTER TWO
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0005 THE HUDSON'S BAY FUR COMPANY CAPTAIN CRAVENTY MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0006 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0007 I THINK HE IS AN OFFICER WHO WILL GO FAR WHAT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0008 DO YOU MEAN BY THE WORDS WILL GO FAR DO
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0009 YOU MEAN THAT HE WILL GO BEYOND THE TWENTY FOURTH PARALLEL
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0010 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT MRS PAULINA BARNETT'S QUESTION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0011 THEY WERE TALKING TOGETHER NEAR THE STOVE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0012 WHILST THE GUESTS WERE PASSING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN THE EATING AND DRINKING TABLES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0013 MADAM REPLIED THE CAPTAIN ALL THAT A MAN CAN DO WILL BE DONE BY JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0014 THE COMPANY HAS CHARGED HIM TO EXPLORE THE NORTH OF THEIR POSSESSIONS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0015 AND TO ESTABLISH A FACTORY AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0016 AND HE WILL ESTABLISH IT THAT IS A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0017 SAID THE TRAVELLER IT IS MADAM BUT JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0018 HAS NEVER YET DRAWN BACK FROM A TASK IMPOSED UPON HIM
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0019 HOWEVER FORMIDABLE IT MAY HAVE APPEARED I CAN QUITE BELIEVE IT CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0020 REPLIED MRS BARNETT AND WE SHALL NOW SEE THE LIEUTENANT AT WORK
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0021 BUT WHAT INDUCES THE COMPANY TO CONSTRUCT A FORT ON THE SHORES OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0022 THEY HAVE A POWERFUL MOTIVE MADAM REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0023 I MAY ADD A DOUBLE MOTIVE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0024 AT NO VERY DISTANT DATE RUSSIA WILL PROBABLY CEDE HER AMERICAN POSSESSIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0025 WHEN THIS CESSION HAS TAKEN PLACE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0026 THE COMPANY WILL FIND ACCESS TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0027 UNLESS THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE DISCOVERED BY MCCLURE BE PRACTICABLE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0028 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S PROPHECY HAS SINCE BEEN REALISED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0029 FRESH EXPLORATIONS WILL DECIDE THIS FOR
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0030 THE ADMIRALTY IS ABOUT TO SEND A VESSEL
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0031 WHICH WILL COAST ALONG THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0032 FROM BEHRING STRAIT TO CORONATION GULF ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF WHICH
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0033 THE NEW ART IS TO BE ESTABLISHED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0034 IF THE ENTERPRISE SUCCEED THIS POINT WILL BECOME AN IMPORTANT FACTORY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0035 THE CENTRE OF THE NORTHERN FUR TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0036 THE TRANSPORT OF FURS ACROSS THE INDIAN TERRITORIES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0037 INVOLVES A VAST EXPENDITURE OF TIME AND MONEY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0038 WHEREAS IF THE NEW ROUTE BE AVAILABLE STEAMERS WILL TAKE THEM
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0039 FROM THE NEW FORT TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN IN A FEW DAYS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0040 THAT WOULD INDEED BE AN IMPORTANT RESULT OF THE ENTERPRISE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0041 IF THIS NORTH WEST PASSAGE CAN REALLY BE USED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0042 REPLIED MRS PAULINA BARNETT BUT I THINK YOU SPOKE OF A DOUBLE MOTIVE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0043 I DID MADAM SAID THE CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0044 AND I ALLUDED TO A MATTER OF VITAL INTEREST TO THE COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0045 BUT I MUST BEG OF YOU
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0046 TO ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IN A FEW WORDS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0047 HOW THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS CAME ABOUT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0048 HOW IT IS IN FACT THAT THE VERY SOURCE OF THE TRADE OF THIS ONCE FLOURISHING COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0049 IS IN DANGER OF DESTRUCTION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0050 THE CAPTAIN THEN PROCEEDED TO GIVE A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE FAMOUS HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0051 IN THE EARLIEST TIMES MEN EMPLOYED THE SKINS AND FURS OF ANIMALS AS CLOTHING
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0052 THE FUR TRADE IS THEREFORE OF VERY GREAT ANTIQUITY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0053 LUXURY IN DRESS INCREASED TO SUCH AN EXTENT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0054 THAT SUMPTUARY LAWS WERE ENACTED TO CONTROL TOO GREAT EXTRAVAGANCE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0055 ESPECIALLY IN FURS FOR WHICH THERE WAS A POSITIVE PASSION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0056 VAIR AND THE FURS OF SIBERIAN SQUIRRELS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0057 WERE PROHIBITED AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0058 IN FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE RUSSIA FOUNDED SEVERAL ESTABLISHMENTS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0059 IN THE NORTHERN STEPPES AND ENGLAND LOST NO TIME IN FOLLOWING HER EXAMPLE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0060 THE TRADE IN SABLES ERMINES AND BEAVERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0061 WAS CARRIED ON THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THE SAMOYEDES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0062 BUT DURING THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH A ROYAL DECREE RESTRICTED THE USE OF COSTLY FURS TO SUCH AN EXTENT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0063 THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS THIS BRANCH OF INDUSTRY WAS COMPLETELY PARALYSED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0064 ON THE SECOND MAY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0065 SIXTEEN SEVENTY A LICENCE TO TRADE IN FURS IN THE HUDSON'S BAY TERRITORY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0066 WAS GRANTED TO THE COMPANY WHICH NUMBERED SEVERAL MEN OF HIGH RANK AMONGST ITS SHAREHOLDERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0067 THE DUKE OF YORK THE DUKE OF ALBEMARLE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0068 THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY AND COMPANY ITS CAPITAL WAS THEN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0069 ONLY EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0070 PRIVATE COMPANIES WERE FORMIDABLE RIVALS TO ITS SUCCESS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0071 AND FRENCH AGENTS MAKING CANADA THEIR HEADQUARTERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0072 VENTURED ON HAZARDOUS BUT MOST LUCRATIVE EXPEDITIONS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0073 THE ACTIVE COMPETITION OF THESE BOLD HUNTERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0074 THREATENED THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE INFANT COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0075 THE CONQUEST OF CANADA HOWEVER SOMEWHAT LESSENED THE DANGER OF ITS POSITION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0076 THREE YEARS AFTER THE TAKING OF QUEBEC SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0077 THE FUR TRADE RECEIVED A NEW IMPULSE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0078 ENGLISH TRADERS BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRADE OF THIS KIND
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0079 THEY LEARNED THE CUSTOMS OF THE COUNTRY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0080 THE WAYS OF THE INDIANS AND THEIR SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE OF GOODS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0081 BUT FOR ALL THIS THE COMPANY AS YET MADE NO PROFITS WHATEVER
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0082 MOREOVER TOWARDS SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SOME MERCHANTS OF MONTREAL
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0083 COMBINED TO EXPLORE THE FUR COUNTRY AND FOUNDED THAT POWERFUL NORTH WEST COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0084 WHICH SOON BECAME THE CENTRE OF THE FUR TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0085 IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0086 THE NEW COMPANY SHIPPED FURS TO THE VALUE OF NO LESS THAN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0087 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0088 AND THE EXISTENCE OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY WAS AGAIN THREATENED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0089 WE MUST ADD THAT THE NORTH WEST COMPANY SHRANK FROM NO ACT HOWEVER INIQUITOUS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0090 IF ITS INTERESTS WERE AT STAKE ITS AGENTS IMPOSED ON THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0091 SPECULATED ON THE MISERY OF THE INDIANS ROBBED THEM WHEN THEY HAD THEMSELVES MADE THEM DRUNK
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0092 SETTING AT DEFIANCE THE ACT OF PARLIAMENT FORBIDDING THE SALE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0093 OF SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS ON INDIAN TERRITORY AND CONSEQUENTLY REALISING IMMENSE PROFITS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0094 IN SPITE OF THE COMPETITION OF THE VARIOUS RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN COMPANIES WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0095 THE AMERICAN FUR COMPANY AMONGST OTHERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0096 FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN OH NINE WITH A CAPITAL OF A MILLION OF DOLLARS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0097 WHICH WAS CARRYING ON OPERATIONS ON THE WEST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0098 THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY WAS PROBABLY IN GREATER DANGER OF RUIN THAN ANY OTHER
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0099 BUT IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0100 A TREATY WAS MADE IN ACCORDANCE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0101 WITH WHICH ITS OLD RIVAL THE NORTH WEST COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0102 BECAME AMALGAMATED WITH IT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0103 THE TWO RECEIVING THE COMMON TITLE OF THE HUDSON'S BAY FUR COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0104 NOW THE ONLY RIVAL OF THIS IMPORTANT ASSOCIATION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0105 IS THE AMERICAN ST LOUIS FUR COMPANY THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0106 HAS NUMEROUS ESTABLISHMENTS SCATTERED OVER A DOMAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0107 EXTENDING OVER THREE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE MILES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0108 ITS PRINCIPAL FACTORIES ARE SITUATED ON JAMES BAY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0109 AT THE MOUTH OF THE SEVERN IN THE SOUTH
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0110 AND TOWARDS THE FRONTIERS OF UPPER CANADA ON LAKES ATHAPESKOW
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0111 WINNIPEG SUPERIOR METHYE BUFFALO AND NEAR THE COLOMBIA MACKENZIE SASKATCHEWAN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0112 AND ASSINIBOIN RIVERS AND COMPANY FORT YORK
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0113 COMMANDING THE COURSE OF THE RIVER NELSON
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0114 IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMPANY AND CONTAINS ITS PRINCIPAL FUR DEPOT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0115 MOREOVER IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO IT TOOK A LEASE OF ALL THE RUSSIAN ESTABLISHMENTS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0116 IN NORTH AMERICA AT AN ANNUAL RENT OF FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0117 SO THAT IT IS NOW WORKING ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0118 THE VAST TRACTS OF COUNTRY BETWEEN THE MISSISSIPPI AND THE PACIFIC OCEAN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0119 IT HAS SENT OUT INTREPID EXPLORERS IN EVERY DIRECTION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0120 HEARNE TOWARDS THE POLAR SEA IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0121 TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE COPPERMINE RIVER
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0122 FRANKLIN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0123 ALONG FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0124 OF THE AMERICAN COAST MACKENZIE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0125 WHO AFTER HAVING DISCOVERED THE RIVER TO WHICH HE GAVE HIS NAME
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0126 REACHED THE SHORES OF THE PACIFIC
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0127 AT FIFTY TWO DEGREES TWENTY FOUR MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0128 THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THE QUANTITIES OF SKINS AND FURS DESPATCHED TO EUROPE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0129 BY THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOUR
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0130 WHICH WILL GIVE AN EXACT IDEA OF THE EXTENT OF ITS TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0131 BEAVERS ONE THOUSAND AND SEVENTY FOUR SKINS AND YOUNG BEAVERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0132 NINETY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MUSK RATS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0133 SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND AND NINETY TWO BADGERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0134 ONE THOUSAND AND SIXTY NINE BEARS SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0135 ERMINES FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE FOES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0136 NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN LYNXES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0137 FOURTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE SABLES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0138 SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY POLECATS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0139 TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED OTTERS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THREE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0140 RACOONS SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN SWANS SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0141 WOLVES EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR WOLVERINES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0142 ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0143 SUCH FIGURES OUGHT TO BRING IN A LARGE PROFIT TO THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0144 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MAINTAINED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0145 AND FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE BEEN DECREASING
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0146 THE CAUSE OF THIS DECLINE WAS THE SUBJECT OF CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S EXPLANATION TO MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0147 UNTIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE MADAM SAID HE THE COMPANY WAS IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0148 IN THAT YEAR THE NUMBER OF FURS EXPORTED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0149 WAS TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0150 BUT SINCE THEN THE TRADE HAS GRADUALLY DECLINED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0151 AND THIS NUMBER IS NOW REDUCED BY ONE HALF AT LEAST
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0152 BUT WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IS THE CAUSE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY DECREASE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0153 IN THE EXPORTATION OF FURS INQUIRED MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0154 THE DEPOPULATION OF THE HUNTING TERRITORIES CAUSED BY THE ACTIVITY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0155 AND I MUST ADD THE WANT OF FORESIGHT OF THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0156 THE GAME WAS TRAPPED AND KILLED WITHOUT MERCY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0157 THESE MASSACRES WERE CONDUCTED IN THE MOST RECKLESS AND SHORT SIGHTED FASHION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0158 EVEN FEMALES WITH YOUNG AND THEIR LITTLE ONES DID NOT ESCAPE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0159 THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE ANIMALS WHOSE FUR IS VALUABLE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0160 HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY RARE THE OTTER HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0161 AND IS ONLY TO BE FOUND NEAR THE ISLANDS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0162 SMALL COLONIES OF BEAVERS HAVE TAKEN REFUGE ON THE SHORES OF THE MOST DISTANT RIVERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0163 IT IS THE SAME WITH MANY OTHER ANIMALS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0164 COMPELLED TO FLEE BEFORE THE INVASION OF THE HUNTERS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0165 THE TRAPS ONCE CROWDED WITH GAME ARE NOW EMPTY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0166 THE PRICE OF SKINS IS RISING JUST WHEN A GREAT DEMAND EXISTS FOR FURS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0167 HUNTERS HAVE GONE AWAY IN DISGUST LEAVING NONE BUT THE MOST INTREPID AND INDEFATIGABLE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0168 WHO NOW PENETRATE TO THE VERY CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0169 YES SAID MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0170 THE FACT OF THE FUR BEARING ANIMALS HAVING TAKEN REFUGE BEYOND THE POLAR CIRCLE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0171 IS A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION OF THE COMPANY'S MOTIVE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0172 IN FOUNDING A FACTORY ON THE BORDERS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0173 NOT ONLY SO MADAM REPLIED THE CAPTAIN THE COMPANY IS ALSO COMPELLED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0174 TO SEEK A MORE NORTHERN CENTRE OF OPERATIONS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0175 FOR AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT HAS LATELY GREATLY REDUCED ITS DOMAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0176 AND THE MOTIVE FOR THIS REDUCTION INQUIRED THE TRAVELLER
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0177 A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION OF POLITICAL ECONOMY WAS INVOLVED MADAM
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0178 ONE WHICH COULD NOT FAIL GREATLY TO INTEREST THE STATESMEN OF GREAT BRITAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0179 IN A WORD THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND THOSE OF CIVILISATION ARE ANTAGONISTIC
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0180 IT IS TO THE INTEREST OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0181 TO KEEP THE TERRITORY BELONGING TO IT IN A WILD UNCULTIVATED CONDITION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0182 EVERY ATTEMPT AT CLEARING GROUND
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0183 WAS PITILESSLY PUT A STOP TO AS IT DROVE AWAY THE WILD ANIMALS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0184 SO THAT THE MONOPOLY ENJOYED BY THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0185 WAS DETRIMENTAL TO ALL AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0186 ALL QUESTIONS NOT IMMEDIATELY RELATING TO THEIR OWN PARTICULAR TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0187 WERE RELENTLESSLY PUT ASIDE BY THE GOVERNORS OF THE ASSOCIATION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0188 IT WAS THIS DESPOTIC AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE IMMORAL SYSTEM
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0189 WHICH PROVOKED THE MEASURES TAKEN BY PARLIAMENT
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0190 AND IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THE COLONIAL SECRETARY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0191 DECIDED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ANNEX TO CANADA
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0192 ALL THE TERRITORIES SUITABLE FOR CULTIVATION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0193 SUCH AS THE RED RIVER AND SASKATCHEWAN DISTRICTS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0194 AND TO LEAVE TO THE COMPANY ONLY THAT PORTION OF ITS LAND
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0195 WHICH APPEARED TO BE INCAPABLE OF FUTURE CIVILISATION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0196 THE NEXT YEAR THE COMPANY LOST THE WESTERN SLOPES OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0197 WHICH IT HELD DIRECT FROM THE COLONIAL OFFICE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0198 AND YOU WILL NOW UNDERSTAND MADAM HOW THE AGENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVING LOST THEIR POWER
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0199 OVER THEIR OLD TERRITORIES ARE DETERMINED BEFORE GIVING UP THEIR TRADE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0200 TO TRY TO WORK THE LITTLE KNOWN COUNTRIES OF THE NORTH
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0201 AND SO OPEN A COMMUNICATION WITH THE PACIFIC BY MEANS OF THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0202 MRS PAULINA BARNETT WAS NOW WELL INFORMED AS TO THE ULTERIOR PROJECTS OF THE CELEBRATED COMPANY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0203 CAPTAIN CRAVENTY HAD GIVEN HER A GRAPHIC SKETCH OF THE SITUATION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0204 AND IT IS PROBABLE HE WOULD HAVE ENTERED INTO FURTHER DETAILS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0205 HAD NOT AN INCIDENT CUT SHORT HIS HARANGUE CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0206 ANNOUNCED IN A LOUD VOICE THAT WITH MRS JOLIFFE'S ASSISTANCE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0207 HE WAS ABOUT TO MIX THE PUNCH
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0208 THIS NEWS WAS RECEIVED AS IT DESERVED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0209 THE BOWL OR RATHER THE BASIN WAS FILLED WITH THE PRECIOUS LIQUID
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0210 IT CONTAINED NO LESS THAN TEN PINTS OF COARSE RUM
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0211 SUGAR MEASURED OUT BY MRS JOLIFFE WAS PILED UP AT THE BOTTOM
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0212 AND ON THE TOP FLOATED SLICES OF LEMON SHRIVELLED WITH AGE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0213 NOTHING REMAINED TO BE DONE BUT TO LIGHT THIS ALCOHOLIC LAKE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0214 AND THE CORPORAL MATCH IN HAND AWAITED THE ORDER OF HIS CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0215 AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO SPRING A MINE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0216 ALL RIGHT JOLIFFE AT LAST SAID CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0217 THE LIGHT WAS APPLIED TO THE BOWL
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0218 AND IN A MOMENT THE PUNCH WAS IN FLAMES
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0219 WHILST THE GUESTS APPLAUDED AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0220 TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS FULL GLASSES OF THE DELIGHTFUL BEVERAGE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0221 WERE CIRCULATING AMONGST THE GUESTS FRESH BIDDERS FOR THEM COMING FORWARD IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0222 LIKE SPECULATORS ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE HURRAH HURRAH HURRAH
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0223 THREE CHEERS FOR MRS BARNETT A CHEER FOR THE CAPTAIN
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0224 IN THE MIDST OF THESE JOYFUL SHOUTS CRIES WERE HEARD FROM OUTSIDE
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0225 SILENCE IMMEDIATELY FELL UPON THE COMPANY ASSEMBLED SERGEANT LONG
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0226 SAID THE CAPTAIN GO AND SEE WHAT IS THE MATTER
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0227 AND AT HIS CHIEF'S ORDER THE SERGEANT LEAVING HIS GLASS UNFINISHED
starlite-20070614-fur2-fur0228 LEFT THE ROOM END OF CHAPTER TWO

starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0005 A SAVANT THAWED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0006 SERGEANT LONG HASTENED TO THE NARROW PASSAGE FROM WHICH OPENED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE FORT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0007 AND HE HEARD THE CRIES REDOUBLED AND COMBINED WITH VIOLENT BLOWS ON THE POSTERN GATE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0008 SURROUNDED BY HIGH WALLS WHICH GAVE ACCESS TO THE COURT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0009 THE SERGEANT PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0010 AND PLUNGING INTO THE SNOW ALREADY A FOOT DEEP
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0011 HE WADED THROUGH IT ALTHOUGH HALF BLINDED BY THE CUTTING SLEET
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0012 AND NIPPED BY THE TERRIBLE COLD
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0013 WHAT THE DEVIL DOES ANY ONE WANT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT EXCLAIMED THE SERGEANT TO HIMSELF
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0014 AS HE MECHANICALLY REMOVED THE HEAVY BARS OF THE GATE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0015 NONE BUT ESQUIMAUX WOULD DARE TO BRAVE SUCH A TEMPERATURE AS THIS

starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0019 AND THE SERGEANT WAS ALMOST UPSET BY A SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0020 DRAWN BY SIX DOGS WHICH DASHED PAST HIM LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0021 WORTHY SERGEANT LONG ONLY JUST ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0022 BUT HE GOT UP WITHOUT A MURMUR
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0023 CLOSED THE GATE AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AT HIS ORDINARY PACE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0024 THAT IS TO SAY AT THE RATE OF SEVENTY FIVE STRIDES A MINUTE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0025 BUT CAPTAIN CRAVENTY LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON AND CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0026 WERE ALREADY OUTSIDE BRAVING THE INTENSE COLD AND STARING AT THE SLEDGE

starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0031 ARE YOU ALONE NO I BRING A TRAVELLER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0032 A TRAVELLER AND WHAT DOES HE WANT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0033 HE IS COME TO SEE THE MOON
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0034 AT THIS REPLY CAPTAIN CRAVENTY SAID TO HIMSELF
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0035 THE MAN MUST BE A FOOL
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0036 BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO ANNOUNCE THIS OPINION
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0037 FOR THE COURIER HAD TAKEN AN INERT MASS FROM THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0038 A KIND OF BAG COVERED WITH SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0039 AND WAS ABOUT TO CARRY IT INTO THE HOUSE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0040 WHEN THE CAPTAIN INQUIRED WHAT IS THAT BAG IT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0041 IS MY TRAVELLER REPLIED THE COURIER WHO IS THIS TRAVELLER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0042 THE ASTRONOMER THOMAS BLACK BUT HE IS FROZEN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0043 WELL HE MUST BE THAWED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0044 THOMAS BLACK CARRIED BY THE SERGEANT THE CORPORAL AND THE COURIER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0045 NOW MADE HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE HOUSE OF THE FORT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0046 AND WAS TAKEN TO A ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0047 THE TEMPERATURE OF WHICH WAS BEARABLE THANKS TO A GLOWING STOVE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0048 HE WAS LAID UPON A BED AND THE CAPTAIN TOOK HIS HAND
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0049 IT WAS LITERALLY FROZEN THE WRAPPERS AND FURRED MANTLES IN WHICH THOMAS BLACK WAS ROLLED UP
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0050 LIKE A PARCEL REQUIRING CARE WERE REMOVED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0051 AND REVEALED A MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0052 HE WAS SHORT AND STOUT HIS HAIR WAS ALREADY TOUCHED WITH GREY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0053 HIS BEARD WAS UNTRIMMED HIS EYES WERE CLOSED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0054 AND HIS LIPS PRESSED TOGETHER AS IF GLUED TO ONE ANOTHER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0055 IF HE BREATHED AT ALL IT WAS SO SLIGHTLY THAT THE FROST WORK ON THE WINDOWS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0056 WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY IT JOLIFFE UNDRESSED HIM
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0057 AND TURNED HIM RAPIDLY ON TO HIS FACE AND BACK AGAIN WITH THE WORDS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0058 COME COME SIR WHEN DO YOU MEAN TO RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0059 BUT THE VISITOR WHO HAD ARRIVED IN SO STRANGE A MANNER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0060 SHOWED NO SIGNS OF RETURNING LIFE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0061 AND CORPORAL JOLIFFE COULD THINK OF NO BETTER MEANS TO RESTORE THE LOST VITAL HEAT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0062 THAN TO GIVE HIM A BATH IN THE BOWL OF HOT PUNCH
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0063 VERY HAPPILY FOR THOMAS BLACK HOWEVER LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON HAD ANOTHER IDEA
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0064 SNOW BRING SNOW HE CRIED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0065 THERE WAS PLENTY OF IT IN THE COURT OF FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0066 AND WHILST THE SERGEANT WENT TO FETCH THE SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0067 JOLIFFE REMOVED ALL THE ASTRONOMER'S CLOTHES
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0068 THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE MAN WAS COVERED WITH WHITE FROST BITTEN PATCHES
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0069 IT WAS URGENTLY NECESSARY TO RESTORE THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IN THE AFFECTED PORTIONS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0070 THIS RESULT JASPAR HOBSON HOPED TO OBTAIN BY VIGOROUS FRICTION WITH THE SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0071 WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE MEANS GENERALLY EMPLOYED IN THE POLAR COUNTRIES TO SET GOING AFRESH THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD ARRESTED BY THE INTENSE COLD
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0072 EVEN AS THE RIVERS ARE ARRESTED IN THEIR COURSES
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0073 BY THE ICY TOUCH OF WINTER SERGEANT LOIN SOON RETURNED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0074 AND HE AND JOLIFFE GAVE THE NEW ARRIVAL SUCH A RUBBING
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0075 AS HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE RECEIVED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0076 IT WAS NO SOFT AND AGREEABLE FRICTION
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0077 BUT A VIGOROUS SHAMPOOING MOST LUSTILY PERFORMED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0078 MORE LIKE THE SCRATCHING OF A CURRY COMB
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0079 THAN THE CARESSES OF A HUMAN HAND AND DURING THE OPERATION
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0080 THE LOQUACIOUS CORPORAL CONTINUED TO EXHORT THE UNCONSCIOUS TRAVELLER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0081 COME COME SIR WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GETTING FROZEN LIKE THIS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0082 NOW DON'T BE SO OBSTINATE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0083 PROBABLY IT WAS OBSTINACY WHICH KEPT THOMAS BLACK FROM DEIGNING TO SHOW A SIGN OF LIFE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0084 AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR THE RUBBERS BEGAN TO DESPAIR
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0085 AND WERE ABOUT TO DISCONTINUE THEIR EXHAUSTING EFFORTS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0086 WHEN THE POOR MAN SIGHED SEVERAL TIMES
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0087 HE LIVES HE IS COMING TO CRIED JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0088 AFTER HAVING WARMED THE OUTSIDE OF HIS BODY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0089 CORPORAL JOLIFFE HURRIED TO DO THE SAME FOR THE INSIDE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0090 AND HASTILY FETCHED A FEW GLASSES OF THE PUNCH
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0091 THE TRAVELLER REALLY FELT MUCH REVIVED BY THEM
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0092 THE COLOUR RETURNED TO HIS CHEEKS EXPRESSION TO HIS EYES
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0093 AND WORDS TO HIS LIPS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0094 SO THAT CAPTAIN CRAVENTY BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE AN EXPLANATION
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0095 FROM THOMAS BLACK HIMSELF OF HIS STRANGE ARRIVAL AT THE FORT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0096 IN SUCH A TERRIBLE CONDITION AT LAST THE TRAVELLER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0097 WELL COVERED WITH WRAPS ROSE ON HIS ELBOW AND SAID IN A VOICE STILL FAINT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0098 FORT RELIANCE THE SAME REPLIED THE CAPTAIN CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0099 HE IS BEFORE YOU AND IS HAPPY TO BID YOU WELCOME
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0100 BUT MAY I INQUIRE WHAT BRINGS YOU TO FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0101 HE IS COME TO SEE THE MOON REPLIED THE COURIER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0102 WHO EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THIS A HAPPY ANSWER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0103 IT SATISFIED THOMAS BLACK TOO FOR HE BENT HIS HEAD IN ASSENT AND RESUMED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0104 LIEUTENANT HOBSON I AM HERE REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0105 YOU HAVE NOT YET STARTED NOT YET SIR
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0106 THEN REPLIED THOMAS BLACK I HAVE ONLY TO THANK YOU
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0107 AND TO GO TO SLEEP UNTIL TO MORROW MORNING
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0108 THE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS RETIRED LEAVING THEIR STRANGE VISITOR TO HIS REPOSE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0109 HALF AN HOUR LATER THE FETE WAS AT AN END
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0110 AND THE GUESTS HAD REGAINED THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0111 EITHER IN THE DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE FORT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0112 OR THE SCATTERED HOUSES OUTSIDE THE ENCEINTE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0113 THE NEXT DAY THOMAS BLACK WAS RATHER BETTER HIS VIGOROUS CONSTITUTION HAD THROWN OFF THE EFFECTS OF THE TERRIBLE CHILL HE HAD HAD
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0114 ANY ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE DIED FROM IT BUT HE WAS NOT LIKE OTHER MEN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0115 AND NOW WHO WAS THIS ASTRONOMER WHERE DID HE COME FROM
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0116 WHY HAD HE UNDERTAKEN THIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE TERRITORIES OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0117 IN THE DEPTH OF WINTER WHAT DID THE COURIER'S REPLY SIGNIFY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0118 TO SEE THE MOON THE MOON COULD BE SEEN ANYWHERE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0119 THERE WAS NO NEED TO COME TO THE HYPERBOREAN REGIONS TO LOOK AT IT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0120 SUCH WERE THE THOUGHTS WHICH PASSED THROUGH CAPTAIN CRAVENTY'S MIND
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0121 BUT THE NEXT DAY AFTER AN HOUR'S TALK WITH HIS NEW GUEST
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0122 HE HAD LEARNED ALL HE WISHED TO KNOW
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0123 THOMAS BLACK WAS AN ASTRONOMER ATTACHED TO THE GREENWICH OBSERVATORY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0124 SO BRILLIANTLY PRESIDED OVER BY PROFESSOR AIRY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0125 MR BLACK WAS NO THEORIST BUT A SAGACIOUS AND INTELLIGENT OBSERVER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0126 AND IN THE TWENTY YEARS DURING WHICH HE HAD DEVOTED HIMSELF TO ASTRONOMY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0127 HE HAD RENDERED GREAT SERVICES TO THE SCIENCE OF OURANOGRAPHY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0128 IN PRIVATE LIFE HE WAS A SIMPLE NONENTITY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0129 HE EXISTED ONLY FOR ASTRONOMY HE LIVED IN THE HEAVENS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0130 NOT UPON THE EARTH AND WAS A TRUE DESCENDANT OF THE WITTY LA FONTAINE'S SAVANT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0131 WHO FELL INTO A WELL HE COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT STARS AND CONSTELLATIONS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0132 HE OUGHT TO HAVE LIVED IN A TELESCOPE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0133 AS AN OBSERVER BE HAD NOT HIS RIVAL
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0134 HIS PATIENCE WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE HE COULD WATCH FOR MONTHS FOR A COSMICAL PHENOMENON
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0135 HE HAD A SPECIALTY OF HIS OWN TOO HE HAD STUDIED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0136 LUMINOUS METEORS AND SHOOTING STARS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0137 AND HIS DISCOVERIES IN THIS BRANCH OF ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE WERE CONSIDERABLE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0138 WHEN EVER MINUTE OBSERVATIONS OR EXACT MEASUREMENTS AND DEFINITIONS WERE REQUIRED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0139 THOMAS BLACK WAS CHOSEN FOR THE SERVICE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0140 FOR HIS CLEARNESS OF SIGHT WAS SOMETHING REMARKABLE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0141 THE POWER OF OBSERVATION IS NOT GIVEN TO EVERYONE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0142 AND IT WILL NOT THEREFORE BE SURPRISING THAT THE GREENWICH ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0143 SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR THE MISSION WE ARE ABOUT TO DESCRIBE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0144 WHICH INVOLVED RESULTS SO INTERESTING FOR SELENOGRAPHIC SCIENCE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0145 WE KNOW THAT DURING A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0146 THE MOON IS SURROUNDED BY A LUMINOUS CORONA
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0147 BUT WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS CORONA
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0148 IS IT A REAL SUBSTANCE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0149 OR IS IT ONLY AN EFFECT OF THE DIFFRACTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS NEAR THE MOON
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0150 THIS IS A QUESTION WHICH SCIENCE HAS HITHERTO BEEN UNABLE TO ANSWER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0151 AS EARLY AS SEVENTEEN OH SIX THIS LUMINOUS HALO WAS SCIENTIFICALLY DESCRIBED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0152 THE CORONA WAS MINUTELY EXAMINED DURING THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0153 BY LONVILLE AND HALLEY BY MARALDI IN SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0154 BY ANTONIO DE'ULLOA IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0155 BY BONDITCH AND FERRER IN EIGHTEEN OH SIX
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0156 BUT THEIR THEORIES WERE SO CONTRADICTORY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0157 THAT NO DEFINITE CONCLUSION COULD BE ARRIVED AT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0158 DURING THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0159 LEARNED MEN OF ALL NATIONS AIRY ARAGO KEYTAL LANGIER MAUVAIS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0160 OTTO STRUVE PETIT BAILY ETC
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0161 ENDEAVOURED TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PHENOMENON
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0162 BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THEIR EFFORTS THE DISAGREEMENT SAYS ARAGO
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0163 OF THE OBSERVATIONS TAKEN IN DIFFERENT PLACES BY SKILFUL ASTRONOMERS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0164 OF ONE AND THE SAME ECLIPSE HAVE INVOLVED THE QUESTION IN FRESH OBSCURITY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0165 SO THAT IT IS NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY CERTAIN CONCLUSION
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0166 AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENON SINCE THIS WAS WRITTEN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0167 OTHER TOTAL ECLIPSES HAVE BEEN STUDIED WITH NO BETTER RESULTS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0168 YET THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0169 IS OF SUCH VAST IMPORTANCE TO SELENOGRAPHIC SCIENCE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0170 THAT NO PRICE WOULD BE TOO GREAT TO PAY FOR IT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0171 A FRESH OPPORTUNITY WAS NOW ABOUT TO OCCUR
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0172 TO STUDY THE MUCH DISCUSSED CORONA A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0173 TOTAL AT LEAST FOR THE EXTREME NORTH OF AMERICA
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0174 FOR SPAIN AND NORTH AFRICA WAS TO TAKE PLACE ON JULY EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0175 IT WAS ARRANGED BETWEEN THE ASTRONOMERS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0176 THAT SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN AT THE VARIOUS POINTS OF THE ZONE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0177 WHERE THE ECLIPSE WOULD BE TOTAL
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0178 THOMAS BLACK WAS CHOSEN FOR THE EXPEDITION TO NORTH AMERICA
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0179 AND WAS NOW MUCH IN THE SAME SITUATION
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0180 AS THE ENGLISH ASTRONOMERS WHO WERE TRANSPORTED TO NORWAY AND SWEDEN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0181 ON THE OCCASION OF THE ECLIPSE OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0182 IT WILL READILY BE IMAGINED THAT THOMAS BLACK
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0183 SEIZED WITH AVIDITY THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED HIM OF STUDYING THIS LUMINOUS HALO
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0184 HE WAS ALSO TO EXAMINE INTO THE NATURE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0185 OF THE RED PROMINENCES WHICH APPEAR ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EDGE OF THE TERRESTRIAL SATELLITE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0186 WHEN THE TOTALITY OF THE ECLIPSE HAS COMMENCED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0187 AND SHOULD HE BE ABLE SATISFACTORILY TO ESTABLISH THEIR ORIGIN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0188 HE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE APPLAUSE OF THE LEARNED MEN OF ALL EUROPE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0189 THOMAS BLACK EAGERLY PREPARED FOR HIS JOURNEY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0190 HE OBTAINED URGENT LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION TO THE PRINCIPAL AGENTS OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0191 HE ASCERTAINED THAT AN EXPEDITION WAS TO GO TO THE EXTREME NORTH OF THE CONTINENT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0192 TO FOUND A NEW FORT IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO BE LOST
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0193 SO HE SET OUT CROSSED THE ATLANTIC LANDED AT NEW YORK
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0194 TRAVERSED THE LAKES TO THE RED RIVER SETTLEMENT
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0195 AND PRESSED ON FROM FORT TO FORT IN A SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0196 UNDER THE ESCORT OF A COURIER OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0197 IN SPITE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE WINTER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0198 BRAVING ALL THE DANGERS OF A JOURNEY ACROSS THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0199 AND ARRIVING AT FORT RELIANCE ON THE NINETEENTH MARCH
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0200 IN THE CONDITION WE HAVE DESCRIBED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0201 SUCH WAS THE EXPLANATION GIVEN BY THE ASTRONOMER TO CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0202 HE AT ONCE PLACED HIMSELF ENTIRELY AT MR BLACK'S SERVICE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0203 BUT COULD NOT REFRAIN
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0204 FROM INQUIRING WHY HE HAD BEEN IN SUCH A GREAT HURRY TO ARRIVE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0205 WHEN THE ECLIPSE WAS NOT TO TAKE PLACE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0206 EIGHTEEN SIXTY BUT CAPTAIN REPLIED THE ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0207 I HAD HEARD THAT THE COMPANY WAS SENDING AN EXPEDITION
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0208 ALONG THE NORTHERN COAST OF AMERICA AND
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0209 I DID NOT WISH TO MISS THE DEPARTURE OF LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0210 MR BLACK REPLIED THE CAPTAIN IF THE LIEUTENANT HAD ALREADY STARTED
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0211 I SHOULD HAVE FELT IT MY DUTY TO ACCOMPANY YOU MYSELF TO THE SHORES OF THE POLAR SEA
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0212 AND WITH FRESH ASSURANCES OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO SERVE HIM
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0213 THE CAPTAIN AGAIN BADE HIS NEW GUEST WELCOME TO FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur3-fur0214 END OF CHAPTER THREE

starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0005 A FACTORY ONE OF THE LARGEST OF THE LAKES BEYOND THE SIXTY FIRST PARALLEL
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0006 IS THAT CALLED THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0007 IT IS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES LONG BY FIFTY ACROSS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0008 AND IS SITUATED EXACTLY AT SIXTY ONE DEGREES TWENTY FIVE MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0009 AND ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DEGREES WEST LONGITUDE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0010 THE SURROUNDING DISTRICTS SLOPE DOWN TO IT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0011 AND IT COMPLETELY FILLS A VAST NATURAL HOLLOW
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0012 THE POSITION OF THE LAKE IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE HUNTING DISTRICTS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0013 ONCE SWARMING WITH GAME EARLY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0014 NUMEROUS STREAMS EITHER TAKE THEIR RISE FROM IT OR FLOW INTO IT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0015 THE MACKENZIE THE ATHABASCA ETC AND SEVERAL IMPORTANT FORTS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED ON ITS SHORES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0016 FORT PROVIDENCE ON THE NORTH AND FORT RESOLUTION ON THE SOUTH
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0017 FORT RELIANCE IS SITUATED ON THE NORTH EAST EXTREMITY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0018 AND IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILES FROM THE CHESTERFIELD INLET
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0019 A LONG NARROW ESTUARY FORMED BY THE WATERS OF HUDSON'S BAY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0020 THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE IS DOTTED WITH LITTLE ISLANDS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0021 THE GRANITE AND GNEISS OF WHICH THEY ARE FORMED JUTTING UP IN SEVERAL PLACES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0022 ITS NORTHERN BANKS ARE CLOTHED WITH THICK WOODS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0023 SHUTTING OUT THE BARREN FROZEN DISTRICT BEYOND
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0024 NOT INAPTLY CALLED THE CURSED LAND THE SOUTHERN REGIONS ON THE OTHER BAND
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0025 ARE FLAT WITHOUT A RISE OF ANY KIND
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0026 AND THE SOIL IS MOSTLY CALCAREOUS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0027 THE LARGE RUMINANTS OF THE POLAR DISTRICTS THE BUFFALOES OR BISONS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0028 THE FLESH OF WHICH FORMS ALMOST THE ONLY FOOD OF THE CANADIAN
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0029 AND NATIVE HUNTERS SELDOM GO FURTHER NORTH THAN THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0030 THE TREES ON THE NORTHERN SHORES OF THE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0031 FORM MAGNIFICENT FORESTS WE NEED NOT BE ASTONISHED AT MEETING WITH SUCH FINE VEGETATION
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0032 IN THIS REMOTE DISTRICT THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0033 IS NOT REALLY IN A HIGHER LATITUDE THAN STOCKHOLM OR CHRISTIANIA
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0034 WE HAVE ONLY TO REMEMBER THAT THE ISOTHERMAL LINES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0035 OR BELTS OF EQUAL HEAT ALONG WHICH HEAT IS DISTRIBUTED IN EQUAL QUANTITIES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0036 DO NOT FOLLOW THE TERRESTRIAL PARALLELS AND THAT WITH THE SAME LATITUDE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0037 AMERICA IS EVER SO MUCH COLDER THAN EUROPE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0038 IN APRIL THE STREETS OF NEW YORK ARE STILL WHITE WITH SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0039 YET THE LATITUDE OF NEW YORK IS NEARLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE AZORES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0040 THE NATURE OF A COUNTRY ITS POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE OCEANS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0041 AND EVEN THE CONFORMATION OF ITS SOIL ALL INFLUENCE ITS CLIMATE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0042 IN SUMMER FORT RELIANCE WAS SURROUNDED WITH MASSES OF VERDURE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0043 REFRESHING TO THE SIGHT AFTER THE LONG DREARY WINTER
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0044 TIMBER WAS PLENTIFUL IN THESE FORESTS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0045 WHICH CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF POPLAR PINE AND BIRCH
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0046 THE ISLETS ON THE LAKE PRODUCED VERY FINE WILLOWS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0047 GAME WAS ABUNDANT IN THE UNDERWOOD EVEN DURING THE BAD SEASON
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0048 FURTHER SOUTH THE HUNTERS FROM THE FORT SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED BISONS ELKS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0049 AND CANADIAN PORCUPINES THE FLESH OF WHICH IS EXCELLENT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0050 THE WATERS OF THE SLAVE LAKE WERE FULL OF FISH
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0051 TROUT IN THEM ATTAINED TO AN IMMENSE SIZE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0052 THEIR WEIGHT OFTEN EXCEEDING FORTY POUNDS PIKES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0053 VORACIOUS LOBES A SORT OF CHARR OR GRAYLING CALLED BLUE FISH
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0054 AND COUNTLESS LEGIONS OF TITTAMEGS THE COREGONUS OF NATURALISTS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0055 DISPORTED THEMSELVES IN THE WATER SO THAT THE INHABITANTS OF FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0056 WERE WELL SUPPLIED WITH FOOD
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0057 NATURE PROVIDED FOR ALL THEIR WANTS AND CLOTHED IN THE SKINS OF FOXES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0058 MARTENS BEARS AND OTHER ARCTIC ANIMALS THEY WERE ABLE TO BRAVE THE RIGOUR OF THE WINTER
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0059 THE FORT PROPERLY SO CALLED CONSISTED OF A WOODEN HOUSE WITH A GROUND FLOOR
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0060 AND ONE UPPER STOREY IN IT LIVED THE COMMANDANT AND HIS OFFICERS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0061 THE BARRACKS FOR THE SOLDIERS THE MAGAZINES OF THE COMPANY AND THE OFFICES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0062 WHERE EXCHANGES WERE MADE SURROUNDED THIS HOUSE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0063 A LITTLE CHAPEL WHICH WANTED NOTHING BUT A CLERGYMAN AND
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0064 A POWDER MAGAZINE COMPLETED THE BUILDINGS OF THE SETTLEMENT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0065 THE WHOLE WAS SURROUNDED BY PALISADES TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0066 DEFENDED BY A SMALL BASTION
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0067 WITH A POINTED ROOF AT EACH OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE PARALLELOGRAM
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0068 FORMED BY THE ENCEINTE THE FORT WAS THUS PROTECTED FROM SURPRISE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0069 A NECESSARY PRECAUTION IN THE DAYS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0070 WHEN THE INDIANS INSTEAD OF BEING THE PURVEYORS OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0071 FOUGHT FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THEIR NATIVE LAND
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0072 AND WHEN THE AGENTS AND SOLDIERS OF RIVAL ASSOCIATIONS DISPUTED THE POSSESSION OF THE RICH FUR COUNTRY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0073 AT THAT TIME THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0074 EMPLOYED ABOUT A MILLION MEN ON ITS TERRITORIES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0075 IT HELD SUPREME AUTHORITY OVER THEM AN AUTHORITY WHICH COULD EVEN INFLICT DEATH
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0076 THE GOVERNORS OF THE FACTORIES COULD REGULATE SALARIES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0077 AND ARBITRARILY FIX THE PRICE OF PROVISIONS AND FURS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0078 AND AS A RESULT OF THIS IRRESPONSIBLE POWER THEY OFTEN REALISED A PROFIT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0079 OF NO LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED PER CENT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0080 WE SHALL SEE FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0081 TAKEN FROM THE VOYAGE OF CAPTAIN ROBERT LADE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0082 ON WHAT TERMS EXCHANGES WERE FORMERLY MADE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0083 WITH THOSE INDIANS WHO HAVE SINCE BECOME THE BEST HUNTERS OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0084 BEAVERS SKINS WERE THEN THE CURRENCY EMPLOYED IN BUYING AND SELLING
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0085 THE INDIANS PAID FOR ONE GUN TEN BEAVER SKINS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0086 HALF A POUND OF POWDER ONE BEAVER SKIN
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0087 FOUR POUNDS OF SHOT ONE BEAVER SKIN ONE AXE

starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0093 ONE COMB AND ONE LOOKING GLASS TWO BEAVER SKINS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0094 BUT A FEW YEARS AGO BEAVER SKINS BECAME SO SCARCE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0095 THAT THE CURRENCY HAD TO BE CHANGED
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0096 BISON FURS ARE NOW THE MEDIUM OF TRADE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0097 WHEN AN INDIAN PRESENTS HIMSELF AT THE FORT THE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0098 AGENTS OF THE COMPANY GIVE HIM AS MANY PIECES OF WOOD AS HE BRINGS SKINS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0099 AND HE EXCHANGES THESE PIECES OF WOOD FOR MANUFACTURED ARTICLES ON THE PREMISES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0100 AND AS THE COMPANY FIX THE PRICE OF THE ARTICLES THEY BUY AND SELL
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0101 THEY CANNOT FAIL TO REALISE LARGE PROFITS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0102 SUCH WAS THE MODE OF PROCEEDING IN FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0103 AND OTHER FACTORIES SO THAT MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0104 WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORKING OF THE SYSTEM
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0105 DURING HER STAY WHICH EXTENDED UNTIL THE SIXTEENTH APRIL
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0106 MANY A LONG TALK DID SHE HAVE WITH LIEUTENANT HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0107 MANY WERE THE PROJECTS THEY FORMED
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0108 AND FIRMLY WERE THEY BOTH DETERMINED TO ALLOW NO OBSTACLE TO CHECK THEIR ADVANCE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0109 AS FOR THOMAS BLACK HE NEVER OPENED HIS LIPS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0110 EXCEPT WHEN HIS OWN SPECIAL MISSION WAS DISCUSSED
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0111 HE WAS WRAPPED UP IN THE SUBJECT OF THE LUMINOUS CORONA
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0112 AND RED PROMINENCES OF THE MOON HE LIVED BUT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0113 AND IN THE END MADE MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0114 NEARLY AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS HIMSELF HOW EAGER THE TWO
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0115 WERE TO CROSS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0116 AND HOW FAR OFF THE EIGHTEENTH JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0117 APPEARED TO BOTH BUT ESPECIALLY TO THE IMPATIENT GREENWICH ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0118 CAN EASILY BE IMAGINED THE PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0119 COULD NOT BE COMMENCED UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF MARCH
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0120 AND A MONTH PASSED BEFORE THEY WERE COMPLETED
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0121 IN FACT IT WAS A FORMIDABLE UNDERTAKING TO ORGANISE SUCH AN EXPEDITION
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0122 FOR CROSSING THE POLAR REGIONS EVERYTHING HAD TO BETAKEN WITH THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0123 FOOD CLOTHES TOOLS ARMS AMMUNITION AND A NONDESCRIPT COLLECTION OF VARIOUS REQUISITES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0124 THE TROOPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON

starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0139 THE COMPANY HAD COLLECTED EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR THE EXPEDITION
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0140 A DOZEN SLEDGES WITH THEIR TEAMS OF DOGS WERE IN READINESS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0141 THESE PRIMITIVE VEHICLES CONSISTED OF STRONG BUT LIGHT PLANKS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0142 JOINED TOGETHER BY TRANSVERSE BANDS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0143 A PIECE OF CURVED WOOD TURNING UP AT THE END LIKE A SKATE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0144 WAS FIXED BENEATH THE SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0145 ENABLING IT TO CLEAVE THE SNOW WITHOUT SINKING DEEPLY INTO IT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0146 SIX SWIFT AND INTELLIGENT DOGS YOKED TWO AND TWO
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0147 AND CONTROLLED BY THE LONG THONG BRANDISHED BY THE DRIVER

starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0149 THE WARDROBE OF THE TRAVELLERS CONSISTED OF GARMENTS MADE OF REINDEER SKINS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0150 LINED THROUGHOUT WITH THICK FURS

starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0152 FREQUENT IN THESE LATITUDES EACH ONE OFFICER OR SOLDIER
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0153 MALE OR FEMALE WORE SEAL SKIN BOOTS SEWN WITH TWINE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0154 IN THE MANUFACTURE OF WHICH THE NATIVES EXCEL
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0155 THESE BOOTS ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPERVIOUS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0156 AND ARE SO FLEXIBLE THAT THEY ARE ADMIRABLY ADAPTED FOR WALKING
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0157 PINE WOOD SNOW SHOES TWO OR THREE FEET LONG
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0158 CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE WEIGHT OF A MAN ON THE MOST BRITTLE SNOW
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0159 AND ENABLING HIM TO PASS OVER IT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0160 WITH THE RAPIDITY OF A SKATER ON ICE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0161 CAN BE FASTENED TO THE SOLES OF THE SEAL SKIN BOOTS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0162 FUR CAPS AND DEER SKIN BELTS COMPLETED THE COSTUMES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0163 FOR ARMS LIEUTENANT HOBSON HAD THE REGULATION MUSKETOONS PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY

starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0165 ADZES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED IN CARPENTERING THEN THERE WAS THE COLLECTION
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0166 OF ALL THAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR SETTING UP A FACTORY IN THE REMOTE DISTRICT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0167 FOR WHICH THEY WERE BOUND A STOVE A SMELTING FURNACE TWO AIRPUMPS FOR VENTILATION
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0168 AN INDIA RUBBER BOAT ONLY INFLATED WHEN REQUIRED ETC ETC
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0169 THE PARTY MIGHT HAVE RELIED FOR PROVISIONS ON THE HUNTERS AMONGST THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0170 SOME OF THE SOLDIERS WERE SKILFUL TRACKERS OF GAME
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0171 AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF REINDEER IN THE POLAR REGIONS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0172 WHOLE TRIBES OF INDIANS OR ESQUIMAUX DEPRIVED OF BREAD AND ALL OTHER NOURISHMENT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0173 SUBSIST ENTIRELY ON THIS VENISON WHICH IS BOTH ABUNDANT AND PALATABLE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0174 BUT AS DELAYS AND DIFFICULTIES HAD TO BE ALLOWED FOR
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0175 A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS WAS TAKEN WITH THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0176 THE FLESH OF THE BISON ELK AND DEER
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0177 AMASSED IN THE LARGE BATTUES ON THE SOUTH OF THE LAKE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0178 CORNED BEEF WHICH WILL KEEP FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0179 AND SOME INDIAN PREPARATIONS IN WHICH THE FLESH OF ANIMALS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0180 GROUND TO POWDER RETAINS ITS NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES IN A VERY SMALL BULK
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0181 REQUIRING NO COOKING AND FORMING A VERY NOURISHING DIET
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0182 WERE AMONGST THE STORES PROVIDED IN CASE OF NEED
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0183 LIEUTENANT HOBSON LIKEWISE TOOK SEVERAL CASKS OF RUM AND WHISKY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0184 BUT HE WAS FIRMLY RESOLVED TO ECONOMISE THESE SPIRITS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0185 SO INJURIOUS TO THE HEALTH IN COLD LATITUDES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0186 AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE COMPANY HAD PLACED AT HIS DISPOSAL
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0187 A LITTLE PORTABLE MEDICINE CHEST CONTAINING FORMIDABLE QUANTITIES OF LIME JUICE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0188 LEMONS AND OTHER SIMPLE REMEDIES NECESSARY TO CHECK
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0189 OR IF POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THE SCORBUTIC AFFECTIONS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0190 WHICH TAKE SUCH A TERRIBLE FORM IN THESE REGIONS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0191 ALL THE MEN HAD BEEN CHOSEN WITH GREAT CARE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0192 NONE WERE TOO STOUT OR TOO THIN
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0193 AND ALL HAD FOR YEARS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THE SEVERITY OF THE CLIMATE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0194 AND COULD THEREFORE MORE EASILY ENDURE THE FATIGUES OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE POLAR SEA
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0195 THEY WERE ALL BRAVE HIGH SPIRITED FELLOWS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0196 WHO HAD TAKEN SERVICE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0197 DOUBLE PAY HAD BEEN PROMISED THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0198 DURING THEIR STAY AT THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0199 SHOULD THEY SUCCEED IN MAKING A SETTLEMENT BEYOND THE SEVENTIETH PARALLEL
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0200 THE SLEDGE PROVIDED FOR MRS BARNETT AND HER FAITHFUL MADGE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0201 WAS RATHER MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THE OTHERS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0202 SHE DID NOT WISH TO BE TREATED BETTER THAN HER TRAVELLING COMPANIONS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0203 BUT YIELDED TO THE URGENT REQUEST OF CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0204 WHO WAS BUT CARRYING OUT THE WISHES OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0205 THE VEHICLE WHICH BROUGHT THOMAS BLACK TO FORT RELIANCE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0206 ALSO CONVEYED HIM AND HIS SCIENTIFIC APPARATUS FROM IT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0207 A FEW ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH THERE WERE NOT MANY IN THOSE DAYS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0208 A TELESCOPE FOR HIS SELENOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS A SEXTANT FOR TAKING THE LATITUDE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0209 A CHRONOMETER FOR DETERMINING THE LONGITUDES A FEW MAPS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0210 A FEW BOOKS WERE ALL STORED AWAY IN THIS SLEDGE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0211 AND THOMAS BLACK RELIED UPON HIS FAITHFUL DOGS TO LOSE NOTHING BY THE WAY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0212 OF COURSE THE FOOD FOR THE VARIOUS TEAMS WAS NOT FORGOTTEN
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0213 THERE WERE ALTOGETHER NO LESS THAN SEVENTY TWO DOGS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0214 QUITE A HERD TO PROVIDE FOR BY THE WAY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0215 AND IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE HUNTERS TO CATER FOR THEM
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0216 THESE STRONG INTELLIGENT ANIMALS WERE BOUGHT OF THE CHIPPEWAY INDIANS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0217 WHO KNOW WELL HOW TO TRAIN THEM FOR THEIR ARDUOUS CALLING
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0218 THE LITTLE COMPANY WAS MOST SKILFULLY ORGANISED THE ZEAL OF LIEUTENANT JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0219 WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE PROUD OF HIS MISSION AND DEVOTED TO HIS TASK
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0220 HE NEGLECTED NOTHING WHICH COULD INSURE SUCCESS CORPORAL JOLIFFE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0221 ALWAYS A BUSYBODY EXERTED HIMSELF WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY VERY TANGIBLE RESULTS
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0222 BUT HIS WIFE WAS MOST USEFUL AND DEVOTED AND MRS PAULINA BARNETT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0223 HAD ALREADY STRUCK UP A GREAT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE BRISK LITTLE CANADIAN WOMAN
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0224 WHOSE FAIR HAIR AND LARGE SOFT EYES WERE SO PLEASANT TO LOOK AT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0225 WE NEED SCARCELY ADD THAT CAPTAIN CRAVENTY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0226 DID ALL IN HIS POWER TO FURTHER THE ENTERPRISE THE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0227 INSTRUCTIONS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COMPANY
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0228 SHOWED WHAT GREAT IMPORTANCE THEY ATTACHED TO THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPEDITION AND
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0229 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW FACTORY BEYOND THE SEVENTIETH PARALLEL
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0230 WE MAY THEREFORE SAFELY AFFIRM THAT EVERY HUMAN EFFORT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0231 LIKELY TO INSURE SUCCESS WHICH COULD BE MADE WAS MADE
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0232 BUT WHO COULD TELL WHAT INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0233 NATURE MIGHT PLACE IN THE PATH OF THE BRAVE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0234 WHO COULD TELL WHAT AWAITED HIM AND HIS DEVOTED LITTLE BAND
starlite-20070615-fur4-fur0235 END OF CHAPTER FOUR

starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0005 THE FUR COUNTRY BY JULES VERNE PART ONE CHAPTER SEVEN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0006 THE ARCTIC CIRCLE THE EXPEDITION CONTINUED TO ADVANCE TOWARDS THE NORTH WEST
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0007 BUT THE GREAT INEQUALITIES OF THE GROUND
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0008 MADE IT HARD WORK FOR THE DOGS TO GET ALONG
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0009 AND THE POOR CREATURES WHO COULD HARDLY BE HELD IN WHEN THEY STARTED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0010 WERE NOW QUIET ENOUGH
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0011 EIGHT OR TEN MILES A DAY WERE AS MUCH AS THEY COULD ACCOMPLISH
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0012 ALTHOUGH LIEUTENANT HOBSON URGED THEM ON TO THE UTMOST
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0013 HE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET TO FORT CONFIDENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0014 ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE GREAT BEAR LAKE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0015 WHERE HE HOPED TO OBTAIN SOME USEFUL INFORMATION
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0016 HAD THE INDIANS FREQUENTING THE NORTHERN BANKS OF THE LAKE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0017 BEEN ABLE TO CROSS THE DISTRICTS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0018 WAS THE ARCTIC OCEAN OPEN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0019 THESE WERE GRAVE QUESTIONS THE REPLY TO WHICH
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0020 WOULD DECIDE THE FATE OF THE NEW FACTORY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0021 THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THE LITTLE TROOP WAS NOW PASSING
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0022 WAS INTERSECTED BY NUMEROUS STREAMS MOSTLY TRIBUTARIES OF THE TWO LARGE RIVERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0023 THE MACKENZIE AND COPPERMINE WHICH FLOW FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0024 AND EMPTY THEMSELVES INTO THE ARCTIC OCEAN LAKES LAGOONS AND NUMEROUS POOLS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0025 ARE FORMED BETWEEN THESE TWO PRINCIPAL ARTERIES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0026 AND AS THEY WERE NO LONGER FROZEN OVER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0027 THE SLEDGES COULD NOT VENTURE UPON THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0028 AND WERE COMPELLED TO GO AROUND THEM WHICH CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DELAY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0029 LIEUTENANT HOBSON WAS CERTAINLY RIGHT IN SAYING
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0030 THAT WINTER IS THE TIME TO VISIT THE HYPERBOREAN REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0031 FOR THEY ARE THEN FAR EASIER TO TRAVERSE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0032 MRS PAULINA BARNETT HAD REASON TO OWN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0033 THE JUSTICE OF THIS ASSERTION THAN ONCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0034 THIS REGION INCLUDED IN THE CURSED LAND WAS BESIDES COMPLETELY DESERTED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0035 AS ARE THE GREATER PORTION OF THE DISTRICTS OF THE EXTREME NORTH OF AMERICA
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0036 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE IS BUT ONE INHABITANT TO EVERY TEN SQUARE MILES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0037 BESIDES THE SCATTERED NATIVES THERE ARE SOME FEW THOUSAND AGENTS OR SOLDIERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0038 OF THE DIFFERENT FUR TRADING COMPANIES BUT THEY MOSTLY CONGREGATE IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0039 AND ABOUT THE VARIOUS FACTORIES NO HUMAN FOOTPRINTS GLADDENED THE EYES OF THE TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0040 THE ONLY TRACES ON THE SANDY SOIL WERE THOSE OF RUMINANTS AND RODENTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0041 NOW AND THEN A FIERCE POLAR BEAR WAS SEEN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0042 AND MRS PAULINA BARNETT EXPRESSED HER SURPRISE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0043 AT NOT MEETING MORE OF THESE TERRIBLE CARNIVOROUS BEASTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0044 OF WHOSE DAILY ATTACKS ON WHALERS AND PERSONS SHIPWRECKED IN BAFFIN'S BAY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0045 AND ON THE COASTS OF GREENLAND AND SPITZBERGEN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0046 SHE HAD READ IN THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0047 WHO HAD WINTERED IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS WAIT FOR THE WINTER MADAM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0048 REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT WAIT TILL THE COLD MAKES THEM HUNGRY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0049 AND THEN YOU WILL PERHAPS SEE AS MANY AS YOU CARE ABOUT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0050 ON THE TWENTY THIRD MAY AFTER A LONG AND FATIGUING JOURNEY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0051 THE EXPEDITION AT LAST REACHED THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0052 WE KNOW THAT THIS LATITUDE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0053 TWENTY THREE DEGREES TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS FROM THE NORTH POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0054 FORMS THE MATHEMATICAL LIMIT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0055 BEYOND WHICH THE RAYS OF THE SUN DO NOT PENETRATE IN THE WINTER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0056 WHEN THE NORTHERN DISTRICTS OF THE GLOBE ARE TURNED AWAY FROM THE ORB OF DAY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0057 HERE THEN THE TRAVELLERS ENTERED THE TRUE ARCTIC REGION
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0058 THE NORTHERN FRIGID ZONE THE LATITUDE HAD BEEN VERY CAREFULLY OBTAINED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0059 BY MEANS OF MOST ACCURATE INSTRUMENTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0060 WHICH WERE HANDLED WITH EQUAL SKILL BY THE ASTRONOMER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0061 AND BY LIEUTENANT HOBSON MRS BARNETT WAS PRESENT AT THE OPERATION
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0062 AND HAD THE SATISFACTION OF HEARING
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0063 THAT SHE WAS AT LAST ABOUT TO CROSS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0064 IT WAS WITH A FEELING OF JUST PRIDE THAT SHE RECEIVED THE INTELLIGENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0065 YOU HAVE ALREADY PASSED THROUGH THE TWO TORRID ZONES IN YOUR PREVIOUS JOURNEYS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0066 SAID THE LIEUTENANT AND NOW YOU ARE ON THE VERGE OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0067 FEW EXPLORERS HAVE VENTURED INTO SUCH TOTALLY DIFFERENT REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0068 SOME SO TO SPEAK HAVE A SPECIALTY FOR HOT COUNTRIES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0069 AND CHOOSE AFRICA OR AUSTRALIA AS THE FIELD FOR THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0070 SUCH WERE BARTH BURTON LIVINGSTONE SPEKE DOUGLAS STUART ETC
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0071 OTHERS ON THE CONTRARY HAVE A PASSION FOR THE ARCTIC REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0072 STILL SO LITTLE KNOWN MACKENZIE FRANKLIN PENNY KANE PARRY RAE ETC
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0073 PRECEDED US ON OUR PRESENT JOURNEY BUT WE MUST CONGRATULATE YOU MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0074 ON BEING A MORE COSMOPOLITAN TRAVELLER THAN ALL OF THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0075 I MUST SEE EVERYTHING OR AT LEAST TRY TO SEE EVERYTHING LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0076 REPLIED MRS PAULINA AND I THINK THE DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0077 ARE ABOUT EQUAL EVERYWHERE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0078 ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT TO DREAD THE FEVERS OF THE UNHEALTHY TORRID REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0079 OR THE ATTACKS OF THE FIERCE BLACK RACES IN THIS FRIGID ZONE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0080 THE COLD IS A NO LESS FORMIDABLE ENEMY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0081 AND I SUSPECT THAT THE WHITE BEARS WE ARE LIABLE TO MEET WITH HERE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0082 WILL GIVE US QUITE AS WARM A RECEPTION AS WOULD THE TIERS OF THIBET
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0083 OR THE LIONS OF AFRICA IN TORRID AND FRIGID ZONES ALIKE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0084 THERE ARE VAST UNEXPLORED TRACTS WHICH WILL LONG DEFY THE EFFORTS OF THE BOLDEST ADVENTURERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0085 YES MADAM REPLIED JASPAR HOBSON BUT I THINK THE HYPERBOREAN REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0086 WILL LONGER RESIST THOROUGH EXPLORATION THE NATIVES ARE THE CHIEF OBSTACLE IN TROPICAL REGIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0087 AND I AM WELL AWARE HOW MANY TRAVELLERS HAVE FALLEN VICTIMS TO SAVAGES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0088 BUT CIVILISATION WILL NECESSARILY SUBDUE THE WILD RACES SOONER OR LATER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0089 WHEREAS IN THE ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC ZONES IT IS NOT THE INHABITANTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0090 WHO ARREST THE PROGRESS OF THE EXPLORER BUT NATURE HERSELF
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0091 WHO REPELS THOSE WHO APPROACH HER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0092 AND PARALYSES THEIR ENERGIES WITH THE BITTER COLD
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0093 YOU THINK THEN THAT THE SECRETS OF THE MOST REMOTE DISTRICTS OF AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0094 WILL HAVE BEEN FATHOMED BEFORE THE FRIGID ZONE HAS BEEN ENTIRELY EXAMINED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0095 YES MADAM REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT AND I THINK MY OPINION IS FOUNDED ON FACTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0096 THE MOST INTREPID DISCOVERERS OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS PARRY PENNY FRANKLIN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0097 MCCLURE DANE AND MORTON DID NOT GET BEYOND EIGHTY THREE DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0098 SEVEN DEGREES FROM THE POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0099 WHEREAS AUSTRALIA HAS SEVERAL TIMES BEEN CROSSED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH BY THE BOLD STUART
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0100 AND EVEN AFRICA WITH ALL ITS TERRORS WAS TRAVERSED BY LIVINGSTONE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0101 FROM THE BAY OF LOANGA TO THE MOUTH OF THE ZAMBESI
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0102 WE ARE THEREFORE NEARER TO GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE EQUATORIAL COUNTRIES THAN OF THE POLAR DISTRICTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0103 DO YOU THINK THAT THE POLE ITSELF WILL EVER BE REACHED BY MAN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0104 INQUIRED MRS PAULINA BARNETT CERTAINLY REPLIED HOBSON ADDING WITH A SMILE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0105 BY MAN OR WOMAN BUT I THINK OTHER MEANS MUST BE TRIED OF REACHING THIS POINT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0106 WHERE ALL THE MERIDIANS OF THE GLOBE CROSS EACH OTHER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0107 THAN THOSE HITHERTO ADOPTED BY TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0108 WE HEAR OF THE OPEN SEA OF WHICH CERTAIN EXPLORERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0109 ARE SAID TO HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0110 BUT IF SUCH A SEA FREE FROM ICE REALLY EXIST
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0111 IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET AT AND NO ONE CAN SAY POSITIVELY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0112 WHETHER IT EXTENDS TO THE NORTH POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0113 FOR MY PART I THINK AN OPEN SEA WOULD INCREASE RATHER THAN LESSEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF EXPLORERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0114 AS FOR ME I WOULD RATHER COUNT UPON FIRM FOOTING
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0115 WHETHER ON ICE OR ROCK ALL THE WAY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0116 THEN I WOULD ORGANISE SUCCESSIVE EXPEDITIONS ESTABLISHING DEPOTS OF PROVISIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0117 AND FUEL NEARER AND NEARER TO THE POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0118 AND SO WITH PLENTY OF TIME PLENTY OF MONEY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0119 AND PERHAPS THE SACRIFICE OF A GOOD MANY LIVES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0120 I SHOULD IN THE END SOLVE THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0121 I SHOULD I THINK AT LAST REACH THE HITHERTO INACCESSIBLE GOAL
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0122 I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT LIEUTENANT SAID MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0123 AND IF EVER YOU TRY THE EXPERIMENT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0124 I SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO JOIN YOU AND
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0125 WOULD GLADLY GO TO SET UP THE UNION JACK AT THE NORTH POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0126 BUT THAT IS NOT OUR PRESENT OBJECT NOT OUR IMMEDIATE OBJECT MADAM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0127 REPLIED HOBSON BUT WHEN ONCE THE PROJECTS OF THE COMPANY ARE REALISED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0128 WHEN THE NEW FORT HAS BEEN ERECTED ON THE CONFINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0129 IT MAY BECOME THE NATURAL STARTING POINT OF ALL EXPEDITIONS TO THE NORTH
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0130 BESIDES SHOULD THE FUR YIELDING ANIMALS TOO ZEALOUSLY HUNTED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0131 TAKE REFUGE AT THE POLE WE SHOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0132 UNLESS COSTLY FURS SHOULD GO OUT OF FASHION REPLIED MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0133 O MADAM CRIED THE LIEUTENANT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME PRETTY WOMAN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0134 WHOSE WISH FOR A SABLE MUFF OR AN ERMINE TIPPET
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0135 MUST BE GRATIFIED I AM AFRAID SO SAID MRS BARNETT LAUGHING
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0136 AND PROBABLY THE FIRST DISCOVERER OF THE POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0137 WILL HAVE BEEN LED THITHER IN PURSUIT OF A SABLE OR A SILVER FOX
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0138 THAT IS MY CONVICTION REPLIED HOBSON SUCH IS HUMAN NATURE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0139 AND GREED OF GAIN WILL ALWAYS CARRY A MAN FURTHER THAN ZEAL FOR SCIENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0140 WHAT DO YOU UTTER SUCH SENTIMENTS EXCLAIMED MRS BARNETT WELL MADAM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0141 WHAT AM I BUT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0142 AND DOES THE COMPANY RISK ITS CAPITAL AND AGENTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0143 WITH ANY OTHER HOPE THAN AN INCREASE OF PROFITS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0144 LIEUTENANT HOBSON SAID MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0145 I THINK I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH TO ASSERT THAT ON OCCASION YOU WOULD BE READY TO DEVOTE BODY AND SOUL TO SCIENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0146 IF A PURELY GEOGRAPHICAL QUESTION CALLED YOU TO THE POLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0147 I FEEL SURE YOU WOULD NOT HESITATE TO GO BUT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0148 SHE ADDED WITH A SMILE THE SOLUTION OF THIS GREAT PROBLEM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0149 IS STILL FAR DISTANT WE HAVE BUT JUST REACHED THE VERGE OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE BUT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0150 I HOPE WE MAY CROSS IT WITHOUT ANY VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0151 THAT I FEAR IS DOUBTFUL SAID THE LIEUTENANT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0152 WHO HAD BEEN ATTENTIVELY EXAMINING THE SKY DURING THEIR CONVERSATION
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0153 THE WEATHER HAS LOOKED THREATENING FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0154 LOOK AT THE UNIFORMLY GREY HUE OF THE HEAVENS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0155 THAT MIST WILL PRESENTLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0156 AND IF THE WIND SHOULD RISE EVER SO LITTLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0157 WE SHALL HAVE TO BATTLE WITH A FEARFUL STORM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0158 I WISH WE WERE AT THE GREAT BEAR LAKE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0159 DO NOT LET US LOSE ANY TIME THEN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0160 SAID MRS BARNETT RISING GIVE THE SIGNAL TO START AT ONCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0161 THE LIEUTENANT NEEDED NO URGING
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0162 HAD HE BEEN ALONE OR ACCOMPANIED BY A FEW MEN AS ENERGETIC AS HIMSELF
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0163 HE WOULD HAVE PRESSED ON DAY AND NIGHT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0164 BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR THE FATIGUE OF OTHERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0165 ALTHOUGH HE NEVER SPARED HIMSELF
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0166 HE THEREFORE GRANTED A FEW HOURS OF REST TO HIS LITTLE PARTY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0167 AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THREE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THEY AGAIN SET
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0168 OUT JASPAR HOBSON WAS NOT MISTAKEN IN PROPHESYING A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0169 IT CAME VERY SOON DURING THE AFTERNOON OF THE SAME DAY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0170 THE MIST BECAME THICKER AND ASSUMED A YELLOWISH AND THREATENING HUE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0171 THE LIEUTENANT ALTHOUGH VERY UNEASY ALLOWED NONE OF HIS ANXIETY TO APPEAR
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0172 BUT HAD A LONG CONSULTATION WITH SERGEANT LONG
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0173 WHILST THE DOGS OF HIS SLEDGE WERE LABORIOUSLY PREPARING TO START
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0174 UNFORTUNATELY THE DISTRICT NOW TO BE TRAVERSED WAS VERY UNSUITABLE FOR SLEDGES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0175 THE GROUND WAS VERY UNEVEN RAVINES WERE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0176 AND MASSES OF GRANITE OR HALF THAWED ICEBERGS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0177 BLOCKED UP THE ROAD CAUSING CONSTANT DELAY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0178 THE POOR DOGS DID THEIR BEST
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0179 BUT THE DRIVERS WHIPS NO LONGER PRODUCED ANY EFFECT UPON THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0180 AND SO THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS MEN WERE OFTEN OBLIGED TO WALK
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0181 TO REST THE EXHAUSTED ANIMALS TO PUSH THE SLEDGES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0182 OR EVEN SOMETIMES TO LIFT THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0183 WHEN THE ROUGHNESS OF THE GROUND THREATENED TO UPSET THEM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0184 THE INCESSANT FATIGUE WAS HOWEVER BORNE BY ALL WITHOUT A MURMUR
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0185 THOMAS BLACK ALONE ABSORBED IN HIS ONE IDEA
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0186 NEVER GOT OUT OF HIS SLEDGE AND INDEED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0187 BE WAS SO CORPULENT THAT ALL EXERTION WAS DISAGREEABLE TO HIM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0188 THE NATURE OF THE SOIL CHANGED FROM THE MOMENT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0189 OF ENTERING THE ARCTIC CIRCLE SOME GEOLOGICAL CONVULSION HAD EVIDENTLY UPHEAVED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0190 THE ENORMOUS BLOCKS STREWN UPON THE SURFACE THE VEGETATION TOO
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0191 WAS OF A MORE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0192 WHEREVER THEY WERE SHELTERED FROM THE KEEN NORTH WINDS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0193 THE FLANKS OF THE HILLS WERE CLOTHED NOT ONLY WITH SHRUBS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0194 BUT WITH LARGE TREES ALL OF THE SAME SPECIES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0195 PINES WILLOWS AND FIRS PROVING BY THEIR PRESENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0196 THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VEGETATIVE FORCE IS RETAINED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0197 EVEN IN THE FRIGID ZONE JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0198 HOPED TO FIND SUCH SPECIMENS OF THE ARCTIC FLORA
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0199 EVEN ON THE VERGE OF THE POLAR SEA
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0200 FOR THESE TREES WOULD SUPPLY HIM WITH WOOD TO BUILD HIS FORT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0201 AND FUEL TO WARM ITS INHABITANTS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0202 THE SAME THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH THE MINDS OF HIS COMPANIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0203 AND THEY COULD NOT HELP WONDERING AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS COMPARATIVELY FERTILE REGION
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0204 AND THE LONG WHITE PLAINS STRETCHING BETWEEN THE GREAT SLAVE LAKE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0205 AND FORT ENTERPRISE AT NIGHT THE YELLOW MIST BECAME MORE OPAQUE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0206 THE WIND ROSE THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL IN LARGE FLAKES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0207 AND THE GROUND WAS SOON COVERED WITH A THICK WHITE CARPET
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0208 IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THE SNOW WAS A FOOT DEEP
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0209 AND AS IT DID NOT FREEZE BUT REMAINED IN A LIQUID STATE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0210 THE SLEDGES COULD ONLY ADVANCE WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0211 THE CURVED FRONTS STUCK IN THE SOFT SUBSTANCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0212 AND THE DOGS WERE OBLIGED TO STOP AGAIN AND AGAIN
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0213 TOWARDS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE WIND BECAME VERY BOISTEROUS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0214 THE SNOW DRIVEN BEFORE IT WAS FLUNG UPON THE GROUND
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0215 OR WHIRLED IN THE AIR FORMING ONE HUGE WHIRLPOOL
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0216 THE DOGS BEATEN BACK BY THE SQUALL AND BLINDED WITH SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0217 COULD ADVANCE NO FURTHER THE PARTY WAS THEN IN A NARROW GORGE BETWEEN HUGE ICEBERGS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0218 OVER WHICH THE STORM RAGED WITH FEARFUL FURY PIECES OF ICE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0219 BROKEN OFF BY THE HURRICANE WERE HURLED INTO THE PASS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0220 PARTIAL AVALANCHES ANY ONE OF WHICH
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0221 COULD HAVE CRUSHED THE SLEDGES AND THEIR INMATES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0222 ADDED TO ITS DANGERS AND TO PRESS ON BECAME IMPOSSIBLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0223 THE LIEUTENANT NO LONGER INSISTED AND AFTER CONSULTING WITH SERGEANT LONG
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0224 GAVE THE ORDER TO HALT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0225 IT WAS NOW NECESSARY TO FIND A SHELTER FROM THE SNOW DRIFT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0226 BUT THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER TO MEN ACCUSTOMED TO POLAR EXPEDITIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0227 JASPAR HOBSON AND HIS MEN KNEW WELL WHAT THEY HAD TO DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0228 IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD BEEN SURPRISED BY A TEMPEST
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0229 SOME HUNDRED MILES FROM THE FORTS OF THE COMPANY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0230 WITHOUT SO MUCH AS AN ESQUIMAUX HUT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0231 OR INDIAN HOVEL IN WHICH TO LAY THEIR HEADS TO
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0232 THE ICEBERGS TO THE ICEBERGS CRIED JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0233 EVERY ONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE MEANT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0234 SNOW HOUSES WERE TO BE HOLLOWED OUT OF THE FROZEN MASSES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0235 OR RATHER HOLES WERE TO BE DUG IN WHICH EACH PERSON
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0236 COULD COWER UNTIL THE STORM WAS OVER KNIVES AND HATCHETS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0237 WERE SOON AT WORK ON THE BRITTLE MASSES OF ICE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0238 AND IN THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0239 SOME TEN DENS HAD BEEN SCOOPED OUT LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN TWO OR THREE PERSONS EACH
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0240 THE DOGS WERE LEFT TO THEMSELVES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0241 THEIR OWN INSTINCT LEADING THEM TO FIND SUFFICIENT SHELTER UNDER THE SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0242 BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK ALL THE TRAVELLERS WERE CROUCHING IN THE SNOW HOUSES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0243 IN GROUPS OF TWO OR THREE EACH CHOOSING CONGENIAL COMPANIONS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0244 MRS BARNETT MADGE AND LIEUTENANT HOBSON OCCUPIED ONE HUT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0245 THOMAS BLACK AND SERGEANT LONG ANOTHER AND SO ON
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0246 THESE RETREATS WERE WARM IF NOT COMFORTABLE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0247 AND THE ESQUIMAUX AND INDIANS HAVE NO OTHER REFUGE EVEN IN THE BITTEREST COLD
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0248 THE ADVENTURERS COULD THEREFORE FEARLESSLY AWAIT THE END OF THE STORM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0249 AS LONG AS THEY TOOK CARE NOT TO LET THE OPENINGS OF THEIR HOLES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0250 BECOME BLOCKED UP WITH THE SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0251 WHICH THEY HAD TO SHOVEL AWAY EVERY HALF HOUR
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0252 SO VIOLENT WAS THE STORM THAT EVEN THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS SOLDIERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0253 COULD SCARCELY SET FOOT OUTSIDE FORTUNATELY ALL WERE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT FOOD
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0254 AND WERE ABLE TO ENDURE THEIR BEAVER LIKE EXISTENCE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0255 WITHOUT SUFFERING FROM COLD OR HUNGER
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0256 FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FURY OF THE TEMPEST CONTINUED TO INCREASE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0257 THE WIND ROARED IN THE NARROW PASS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0258 AND TORE OFF THE TOPS OF THE ICEBERGS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0259 LOUD REPORTS REPEATED TWENTY TIMES BY THE ECHOES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0260 GAVE NOTICE OF THE FALL OF AVALANCHES AND JASPAR HOBSON
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0261 BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HIS FURTHER PROGRESS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0262 WOULD BE BARRED BY THE MASSES OF DEBRIS ACCUMULATED BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0263 OTHER SOUNDS MINGLED WITH THESE REPORTS WHICH LIEUTENANT HOBSON KNEW TOO WELL
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0264 AND HE DID NOT DISGUISE FROM MRS BARNETT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0265 THAT BEARS WERE PROWLING ABOUT THE PASS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0266 BUT FORTUNATELY THESE TERRIBLE ANIMALS WERE TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THEIR OWN CONCERNS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0267 TO DISCOVER THE RETREAT OF THE TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0268 NEITHER THE DOGS NOR THE SLEDGES BURIED IN THE SNOW
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0269 ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION AND THEY PASSED ON WITHOUT DOING ANY HARM
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0270 THE LAST NIGHT THAT OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OR TWENTY SIXTH MAY
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0271 WAS EVEN MORE TERRIBLE SO GREAT WAS THE FURY OF THE HURRICANE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0272 THAT A GENERAL OVERTHROW OF ICEBERGS APPEARED IMMINENT A FEARFUL DEATH
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0273 WOULD THEN HAVE AWAITED THE UNFORTUNATE TRAVELLERS
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0274 BENEATH THE RUINS OF THE BROKEN MASSES
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0275 THE BLOCKS OF ICE CRACKED WITH AN AWFUL NOISE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0276 AND CERTAIN OSCILLATIONS GAVE WARNING THAT BREACHES HAD BEEN MADE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0277 THREATENING THEIR SOLIDITY HOWEVER NO GREAT CRASH OCCURRED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0278 THE HUGE MOUNTAINS REMAINED INTACT AND TOWARDS THE END OF THE NIGHT
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0279 ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN CHANGES SO FREQUENT IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS TOOK PLACE
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0280 THE TEMPEST CEASED SUDDENLY BENEATH THE INFLUENCE OF INTENSE COLD
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0281 AND WITH THE FIRST DAWN OF DAY PEACE WAS RESTORED
starlite-20070618-fur7-fur0282 END OF CHAPTER SEVEN
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
sunflame-20090525-hgf-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-05 NOW LOOK HERE NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE FOR YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-06 YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND THAN A BLADE OF GRASS
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
surgemcgee-20120720-oob-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
surgemcgee-20120722-crh-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
surgemcgee-20120722-gyy-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-a0005 WILL WE EVER FORGET IT
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
surgemcgee-20120722-jzb-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0254 STRAIGHT OUT THEY SWAM THEIR HEADS GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0255 YOU WON'T DIE OF MALNUTRITION BE SURE OF THAT
surgemcgee-20120722-oia-a0256 SEE THE LENGTH OF THE BODY AND THAT ELONGATED NECK
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
surgemcgee-20120722-veb-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
tandraericson-20140831-eem-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
tandraericson-20140831-eem-a0481 NIMROD REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT MANIFESTATION OF SENSITIVENESS
tandraericson-20140831-eem-a0482 AND THEIR CHIEF VIRTUE LIES IN THAT THEY WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
tandraericson-20140831-eem-a0483 BEYOND DISPUTE CORRY HUTCHINSON HAD MARRIED MABEL HOLMES
tandraericson-20140831-eem-a0484 NO SIR EE
tandraericson-20140831-eem-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
tandraericson-20140831-gbu-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
tandraericson-20140831-gbu-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
tandraericson-20140831-gbu-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
tandraericson-20140831-gbu-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
tandraericson-20140831-kfr-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
tandraericson-20140831-pdr-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
tandraericson-20140831-rjx-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
taslack-20090113-epc-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
taslack-20090113-vno-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
taslack-20090113-vno-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
taslack-20090113-vno-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
taslack-20090113-vno-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
taslack-20090113-vno-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
taslack-20090113-vno-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
taslack-20090113-vno-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
taslack-20090113-vno-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
taslack-20090113-vno-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
taslack-20090113-vno-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
taslack-20090114-mfh-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
taslack-20090114-mfh-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
taslack-20090114-mfh-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
taslack-20090114-mfh-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
taslack-20090114-mfh-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
taslack-20090114-mfh-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
taslack-20090114-mfh-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
taslack-20090114-mfh-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
taslack-20090114-mfh-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
taslack-20090114-mfh-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
taslack-20090114-rmt-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
tdor-20131029-czi-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
tdor-20131029-czi-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
tdor-20131029-czi-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
tdor-20131029-czi-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
tdor-20131029-czi-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
tdor-20131029-czi-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
tdor-20131029-czi-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
tdor-20131029-czi-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
tdor-20131029-czi-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
tdor-20131029-czi-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
tdor-20131029-hdz-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
tdor-20131029-pyx-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0079 THE TRUTH OF IT SET JEANNE QUIVERING
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
technodemigod-20120719-uqc-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0200 HE LEAPT AGAIN AND THE CLUB CAUGHT HIM ONCE MORE
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0201 HE CRIED AND SWUNG THE CLUB WILDLY
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0202 SHE TURNED FEARING THAT JACQUES MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS IN HER FACE
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0203 THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE SHORE OF A LAKE
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
teeks99-20090406-aai-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
teeks99-20090406-amn-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0201 I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SIMILAR BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN EUROPE
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0202 SOCIETY IS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0203 A MONTH IN AUSTRALIA WOULD FINISH ME
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0204 DOWN THROUGH THE PERFUME WEIGHTED AIR FLUTTERED THE SNOWY FLUFFS OF THE COTTONWOODS
teeks99-20090406-gah-b0205 YOU WERE DESTROYING MY LIFE
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
teeks99-20090406-hnf-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
teeks99-20090406-vjp-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
teeks99-20090406-voa-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
teeks99-20090406-vqd-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0121 I WANT MY MEN TO WORK BY THEMSELVES
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0122 PHILIP SAW MACDOUGALL SOON AFTER HIS SHORT TALK WITH THORPE
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0123 NEITHER COULD THEY UNDERSTAND THE GROWING DISAFFECTION AMONG THORPE'S MEN
teeks99-20090406-xae-b0124 TWO WEEKS PASSED AND IN THAT TIME THORPE LEFT CAMP THREE TIMES
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
teeks99-20090406-ztj-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
teeks99-20090430-cmk-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
teeks99-20090430-dof-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
teeks99-20090430-gjx-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0116 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
teeks99-20090430-jan-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
teeks99-20090430-zjo-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
teeks99-20090430-zup-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0210 WHATEVER HE GUESSED HE LOCKED AWAY IN THE TABOO ROOM OF NAOMI
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0211 THIS IS EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0212 DEATH IS AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE OLD MAUI DIED
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0213 SOME BOY SHE LAUGHED ACQUIESCENCE
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0214 LET US TALK IT OVER AND FIND A WAY OUT
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0215 IT IS A GOOD PROPERTY AND WORTH MORE THAN THAT
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0216 I WISH YOU WERE MORE ADAPTABLE JOAN RETORTED
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0217 SUCH IS MY PASSAGE ENGAGED ON THE STEAMER
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0218 THE ISSUE WAS NOT IN DOUBT
teeks99-20091212-ffu-b0219 WELL THERE ARE BETTER MEN IN HAWAII THAT'S ALL
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
teeks99-20091212-fgq-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
teeks99-20091212-hcd-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
teeks99-20091212-kah-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
teeks99-20091212-nqq-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0478 ALSO SHE HAS FORBIDDEN THEM SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN THE AFTER ROOM
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0479 I TRIED TO READ GEORGE MOORE LAST NIGHT AND WAS DREADFULLY BORED
teeks99-20091212-xle-a0480 TOM SPINK HAS A HARPOON
test-20080617-sbg-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
test-20080617-sbg-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
test-20080617-sbg-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
test-20080617-sbg-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
test-20080617-sbg-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
test-20080617-sbg-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
test-20080617-sbg-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
test-20080617-sbg-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
test-20080617-sbg-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
test-20080617-sbg-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
test-20100811-jxh-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
test-20100811-jxh-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
test-20100811-jxh-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
test-20100811-jxh-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
test-20100811-jxh-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
test-20100811-jxh-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
test-20100811-jxh-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
test-20100811-jxh-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
test-20100811-jxh-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
test-20100811-jxh-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
thatdudeyouknow-20100820-dhd-b0319 TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
thatdudeyouknow-20100820-dhd-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER

thelinuxer-20100125-uif-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED

tis-20080416-tou-voy0005 HE WORKED RIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT I FELL ASLEEP IN A CHAIR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0006 ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING BUMPO FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0007 AND FOR FIVE HOURS THE CURLEW WAS ALLOWED TO DRIFT WHERE SHE LIKED
tis-20080416-tou-voy0008 BUT STILL JOHN DOLITTLE WORKED ON TRYING HIS HARDEST TO UNDERSTAND THE FIDGIT'S LANGUAGE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0009 STRUGGLING TO MAKE THE FIDGIT UNDERSTAND HIM WHEN I WOKE UP IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AGAIN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0010 THE DOCTOR WAS STILL STANDING AT THE LISTENING TANK LOOKING AS TIRED AS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0011 AN OWL AND DREADFULLY WET BUT ON HIS FACE THERE WAS A PROUD AND HAPPY SMILE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0012 STUBBINS HE SAID AS SOON AS HE SAW ME STIR I'VE DONE IT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0013 I'VE GOT THE KEY TO THE FIDGIT'S LANGUAGE IT'S A FRIGHTFULLY DIFFICULT LANGUAGE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0014 QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I EVER HEARD THE ONLY THING IT REMINDS ME OF
tis-20080416-tou-voy0015 SLIGHTLY IS ANCIENT HEBREW IT ISN'T SHELLFISH BUT IT'S A BIG STEP TOWARDS IT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0016 NOW THE NEXT THING I WANT YOU TO TAKE A PENCIL AND A FRESH NOTEBOOK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0017 AND WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING I SAY THE FIDGIT HAS PROMISED TO TELL ME THE STORY OF HIS LIFE

tis-20080416-tou-voy0019 YOU READY ONCE MORE THE DOCTOR LOWERED HIS EAR BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE WATER
tis-20080416-tou-voy0020 AND AS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK I STARTED TO WRITE AND THIS IS THE STORY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0021 THAT THE FIDGIT TOLD US THIRTEEN MONTHS IN AN AQUARIUM I WAS BORN IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0022 CLOSE TO THE COAST OF CHILE I WAS ONE OF A FAMILY OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0023 SOON AFTER OUR MOTHER AND FATHER LEFT US WE YOUNGSTERS GOT SCATTERED THE FAMILY WAS BROKEN UP
tis-20080416-tou-voy0024 BY A HERD OF WHALES WHO CHASED US I AND MY SISTER CLIPPA
tis-20080416-tou-voy0025 SHE WAS MY FAVORITE SISTER HAD A VERY NARROW ESCAPE FOR OUR LIVES AS A RULE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0026 WHALES ARE NOT VERY HARD TO GET AWAY FROM IF YOU ARE GOOD AT DODGING
tis-20080416-tou-voy0027 IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT A QUICK SWERVE BUT THIS ONE THAT CAME AFTER CLIPPA AND MYSELF WAS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0028 A VERY MEAN WHALE EVERY TIME HE LOST US UNDER A STONE OR SOMETHING
tis-20080416-tou-voy0029 HE'D COME BACK AND HUNT AND HUNT TILL HE ROUTED US OUT INTO THE OPEN AGAIN I NEVER SAW SUCH A NASTY PERSEVERING BRUTE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0030 WELL WE SHOOK HIM AT LAST THOUGH NOT BEFORE HE HAD WORRIED US FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES NORTHWARD
tis-20080416-tou-voy0031 UP THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA BUT LUCK WAS AGAINST US THAT DAY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0032 WHILE WE WERE RESTING AND TRYING TO GET OUR BREATH
tis-20080416-tou-voy0033 ANOTHER FAMILY OF FIDGITS CAME RUSHING BY SHOUTING COME ON SWIM FOR YOUR LIVES THE DOG FISH ARE COMING
tis-20080416-tou-voy0034 NOW DOG FISH ARE PARTICULARLY FOND OF FIDGITS WE ARE YOU MIGHT SAY THEIR FAVORITE FOOD
tis-20080416-tou-voy0035 AND FOR THAT REASON WE ALWAYS KEEP AWAY FROM DEEP MUDDY WATERS WHAT'S MORE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0036 DOG FISH ARE NOT EASY TO ESCAPE FROM THEY ARE TERRIBLY FAST AND CLEVER HUNTERS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0037 SO UP WE HAD TO JUMP AND ON AGAIN AFTER WE HAD GONE A FEW MORE HUNDRED MILES WE LOOKED BACK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0038 AND SAW THAT THE DOG FISH WERE GAINING ON US SO WE TURNED INTO A HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0039 IT HAPPENED TO BE ONE ON THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES HERE WE GUESSED
tis-20080416-tou-voy0040 AND HOPED THE DOG FISH WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO FOLLOW US
tis-20080416-tou-voy0041 AS IT HAPPENED THEY DIDN'T EVEN SEE US TURN IN BUT DASHED ON NORTHWARD
tis-20080416-tou-voy0042 AND WE NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN I HOPE THEY FROZE TO DEATH IN THE ARCTIC SEAS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0043 BUT AS I SAID LUCK WAS AGAINST US THAT DAY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0044 WHILE I AND MY SISTER WERE CRUISING GENTLY ROUND THE SHIPS ANCHORED IN THE HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0045 LOOKING FOR ORANGE PEELS A GREAT DELICACY WITH US SWOOP BANG WE WERE CAUGHT IN A NET
tis-20080416-tou-voy0046 WE STRUGGLED FOR ALL WE WERE WORTH BUT IT WAS NO USE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0047 THE NET WAS SMALL MESHED AND STRONGLY MADE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0048 KICKING AND FLIPPING WE WERE HAULED UP THE SIDE OF THE SHIP AND DUMPED DOWN ON THE DECK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0049 HIGH AND DRY IN A BLAZING NOON DAY SUN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0050 HERE A COUPLE OF OLD MEN IN WHISKERS AND SPECTACLES LEANT OVER US MAKING STRANGE SOUNDS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0051 SOME CODLING HAD GOT CAUGHT IN THE NET THE SAME TIME AS WE WERE THESE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0052 THE OLD MEN THREW BACK INTO THE SEA BUT US THEY SEEMED TO THINK VERY PRECIOUS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0053 THEY PUT US CAREFULLY INTO A LARGE JAR AND AFTER THEY HAD TAKEN US ON SHORE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0054 THEY WENT TO A BIG HOUSE AND CHANGED US FROM THE JAR INTO GLASS BOXES FULL OF WATER
tis-20080416-tou-voy0055 THIS HOUSE WAS ON THE EDGE OF THE HARBOR AND A SMALL STREAM OF SEA WATER WAS MADE TO FLOW THROUGH THE GLASS TANK SO WE COULD BREATHE PROPERLY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0056 OF COURSE WE HAD NEVER LIVED INSIDE GLASS WALLS BEFORE AND AT FIRST WE KEPT ON TRYING TO SWIM THROUGH THEM AND GOT OUR NOSES AWFULLY SORE BUMPING THE GLASS AT FULL SPEED
tis-20080416-tou-voy0057 THEN FOLLOWED WEEKS AND WEEKS OF WEARY IDLENESS THEY TREATED US WELL SO FAR AS THEY KNEW HOW
tis-20080416-tou-voy0058 THE OLD FELLOWS IN SPECTACLES CAME AND LOOKED AT US PROUDLY TWICE A DAY AND SAW
tis-20080416-tou-voy0059 THAT WE HAD THE PROPER FOOD TO EAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIGHT AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0060 THAT THE WATER WAS NOT TOO HOT OR TOO COLD BUT OH THE DULLNESS OF THAT LIFE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0061 IT SEEMED WE WERE A KIND OF A SHOW
tis-20080416-tou-voy0062 AT A CERTAIN HOUR EVERY MORNING THE BIG DOORS OF THE HOUSE WERE THROWN OPEN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0063 AND EVERYBODY IN THE CITY WHO HAD NOTHING SPECIAL TO DO CAME IN AND LOOKED AT US
tis-20080416-tou-voy0064 THERE WERE OTHER TANKS FILLED WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISHES ALL ROUND THE WALLS OF THE BIG ROOM AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0065 THE CROWDS WOULD GO FROM TANK TO TANK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0066 LOOKING IN AT US THROUGH THE GLASS WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE HALF WITTED FLOUNDERS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0067 WE GOT SO SICK OF IT THAT WE USED TO OPEN OUR MOUTHS BACK AT THEM AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0068 THIS THEY SEEMED TO THINK HIGHLY COMICAL ONE DAY MY SISTER SAID TO ME
tis-20080416-tou-voy0069 THINK YOU BROTHER THAT THESE STRANGE CREATURES WHO HAVE CAPTURED US CAN TALK SURELY SAID I
tis-20080416-tou-voy0070 HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED THAT SOME TALK WITH THE LIPS ONLY SOME WITH THE WHOLE FACE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0071 AND YET OTHERS DISCOURSE WITH THE HANDS WHEN THEY COME QUITE CLOSE TO THE GLASS YOU CAN HEAR THEM
tis-20080416-tou-voy0072 LISTEN AT THAT MOMENT A FEMALE LARGER THAN THE REST
tis-20080416-tou-voy0073 PRESSED HER NOSE UP AGAINST THE GLASS POINTED AT ME AND SAID TO HER YOUNG BEHIND HER
tis-20080416-tou-voy0074 OH LOOK HERE'S A QUEER ONE AND THEN WE NOTICED THAT THEY NEARLY ALWAYS SAID THIS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0075 WHEN THEY LOOKED IN AND FOR A LONG TIME WE THOUGHT THAT SUCH WAS THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE LANGUAGE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0076 THIS BEING A PEOPLE OF BUT FEW IDEAS TO HELP PASS AWAY THE WEARY HOURS WE LEARNED IT BY HEART
tis-20080416-tou-voy0077 OH LOOK HERE'S A QUEER ONE BUT WE NEVER GOT TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0078 OTHER PHRASES HOWEVER WE DID GET THE MEANING OF AND WE EVEN LEARNED TO READ A LITTLE IN MAN TALK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0079 MANY BIG SIGNS THERE WERE SET UP UPON THE WALLS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0080 AND WHEN WE SAW THAT THE KEEPERS STOPPED THE PEOPLE FROM SPITTING AND SMOKING
tis-20080416-tou-voy0081 POINTED TO THESE SIGNS ANGRILY AND READ THEM OUT LOUD WE KNEW THEN THAT THESE WRITINGS SIGNIFIED
tis-20080416-tou-voy0082 NO SMOKING AND DON'T SPIT THEN IN THE EVENINGS AFTER THE CROWD HAD GONE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0083 THE SAME AGED MALE WITH ONE LEG OF WOOD SWEPT UP THE PEANUT SHELLS WITH A BROOM EVERY NIGHT AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0084 WHILE HE WAS SO DOING HE ALWAYS WHISTLED THE SAME TUNE TO HIMSELF
tis-20080416-tou-voy0085 THIS MELODY WE RATHER LIKED AND WE LEARNED THAT TOO BY HEART
tis-20080416-tou-voy0086 THINKING IT WAS PART OF THE LANGUAGE THUS A WHOLE YEAR WENT BY IN THIS DISMAL PLACE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0087 SOME DAYS NEW FISHES WERE BROUGHT IN TO THE OTHER TANKS AND OTHER DAYS OLD FISHES WERE TAKEN OUT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0088 AT FIRST WE HAD HOPED WE WOULD ONLY BE KEPT HERE FOR A WHILE AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0089 THAT AFTER WE HAD BEEN LOOKED AT SUFFICIENTLY WE WOULD BE RETURNED TO FREEDOM AND THE SEA
tis-20080416-tou-voy0090 BUT AS MONTH AFTER MONTH WENT BY AND WE WERE LEFT UNDISTURBED
tis-20080416-tou-voy0091 OUR HEARTS GREW HEAVY WITHIN OUR PRISON WALLS OF GLASS AND WE SPOKE TO ONE ANOTHER LESS AND LESS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0092 ONE DAY WHEN THE CROWD WAS THICKEST IN THE BIG ROOM A WOMAN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0093 WITH A RED FACE FAINTED FROM THE HEAT I WATCHED THROUGH THE GLASS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0094 AND SAW THAT THE REST OF THE PEOPLE GOT HIGHLY EXCITED
tis-20080416-tou-voy0095 THOUGH TO ME IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE A MATTER OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0096 THEY THREW COLD WATER ON HER AND CARRIED HER OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0097 THIS MADE ME THINK MIGHTILY AND PRESENTLY A GREAT IDEA BURST UPON ME SISTER I SAID
tis-20080416-tou-voy0098 TURNING TO POOR CLIPPA WHO WAS SULKING AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR PRISON
tis-20080416-tou-voy0099 TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND A STONE FROM THE STUPID GAZE OF THE CHILDREN WHO THRONGED ABOUT OUR TANK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0100 SUPPOSING THAT WE PRETENDED WE WERE SICK DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD TAKE US ALSO FROM THIS STUFFY HOUSE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0101 BROTHER SAID SHE WEARILY THAT THEY MIGHT DO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0102 BUT MOST LIKELY THEY WOULD THROW US ON A RUBBISH HEAP WHERE WE WOULD DIE IN THE HOT SUN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0103 BUT SAID I WHY SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD TO SEEK A RUBBISH HEAP
tis-20080416-tou-voy0104 WHEN THE HARBOR IS SO CLOSE WHILE WE WERE BEING BROUGHT HERE I SAW MEN THROWING THEIR RUBBISH INTO THE WATER
tis-20080416-tou-voy0105 IF THEY WOULD ONLY THROW US ALSO THERE WE COULD QUICKLY REACH THE SEA THE SEA
tis-20080416-tou-voy0106 MURMURED POOR CLIPPA WITH A FARAWAY LOOK IN HER EYES SHE HAD FINE EYES HAD MY SISTER CLIPPA
tis-20080416-tou-voy0107 HOW LIKE A DREAM IT SOUNDS THE SEA OH BROTHER WILL WE EVER SWIM IN IT AGAIN THINK YOU
tis-20080416-tou-voy0108 EVERY NIGHT AS I LIE AWAKE ON THE FLOOR OF THIS EVIL SMELLING DUNGEON
tis-20080416-tou-voy0109 I HEAR ITS HEARTY VOICE RINGING IN MY EARS HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR IT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0110 JUST TO FEEL IT ONCE AGAIN THE NICE BIG WHOLESOME HOMELINESS OF IT ALL TO JUMP
tis-20080416-tou-voy0111 JUST TO JUMP FROM THE CREST OF AN ATLANTIC WAVE LAUGHING IN THE TRADE WIND'S SPINDRIFT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0112 DOWN INTO THE BLUE GREEN SWIRLING TROUGH
tis-20080416-tou-voy0113 TO CHASE THE SHRIMPS ON A SUMMER EVENING WHEN THE SKY IS RED AND THE LIGHT'S ALL PINK WITHIN THE FOAM
tis-20080416-tou-voy0114 TO LIE ON THE TOP IN THE DOLDRUMS NOONDAY CALM AND WARM YOUR TUMMY IN THE TROPIC SUN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0115 TO WANDER HAND IN HAND ONCE MORE THROUGH THE GIANT SEAWEED FORESTS OF THE INDIAN OCEAN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0116 SEEKING THE DELICIOUS EGGS OF THE POP POP TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK AMONG THE CASTLES OF THE CORAL TOWNS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0117 WITH THEIR PEARL AND JASPER WINDOWS SPANGLING THE FLOOR OF THE SPANISH MAIN TO PICNIC IN THE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0118 ANEMONE MEADOWS DIM BLUE AND LILAC GRAY THAT LIE IN THE LOWLANDS BEYOND THE SOUTH SEA GARDEN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0119 TO THROW SOMERSAULTS ON THE SPRINGY SPONGE BEDS OF THE MEXICAN GULF
tis-20080416-tou-voy0120 TO POKE ABOUT AMONG THE DEAD SHIPS AND SEE WHAT WONDERS AND ADVENTURES LIE INSIDE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0121 AND THEN ON WINTER NIGHTS WHEN THE NORTHEASTER WHIPS THE WATER INTO FROTH TO SWOOP DOWN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0122 AND DOWN TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD DOWN TO WHERE THE WATER'S WARM AND DARK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0123 DOWN AND STILL DOWN TILL WE SPY THE TWINKLE OF THE FIRE EELS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0124 FAR BELOW WHERE OUR FRIENDS AND COUSINS SIT CHATTING ROUND THE COUNCIL GROTTO CHATTING
tis-20080416-tou-voy0125 BROTHER OVER THE NEWS AND GOSSIP OF THE SEA OH AND THEN SHE BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0126 SNIFFLING STOP IT I SAID YOU MAKE ME HOMESICK LOOK HERE LET'S PRETEND WE'RE SICK OR BETTER STILL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0127 LET'S PRETEND WE'RE DEAD AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY THROW US ON A RUBBISH HEAP AND WE FRY IN THE SUN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0128 WE'LL NOT BE MUCH WORSE OFF THAN WE ARE HERE IN THIS SMELLY PRISON
tis-20080416-tou-voy0129 WHAT DO YOU SAY WILL YOU RISK IT I WILL SHE SAID AND GLADLY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0130 SO NEXT MORNING TWO FIDGITS WERE FOUND BY THE KEEPER FLOATING ON THE TOP OF THE WATER IN THEIR TANK STIFF
tis-20080416-tou-voy0131 AND DEAD WE GAVE A MIGHTY GOOD IMITATION OF DEAD FISH ALTHOUGH I SAY IT MYSELF
tis-20080416-tou-voy0132 THE KEEPER RAN AND GOT THE OLD GENTLEMEN WITH SPECTACLES AND WHISKERS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0133 THEY THREW UP THEIR HANDS IN HORROR WHEN THEY SAW US
tis-20080416-tou-voy0134 LIFTING US CAREFULLY OUT OF THE WATER THEY LAID US ON WET CLOTHS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0135 THAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF ALL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0136 IF YOU'RE A FISH AND GET TAKEN OUT OF THE WATER YOU HAVE TO KEEP OPENING AND SHUTTING YOUR MOUTH TO BREATHE AT ALL AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0137 EVEN THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP UP FOR LONG AND ALL THIS TIME WE HAD TO STAY STIFF AS STICKS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0138 AND BREATHE SILENTLY THROUGH HALF CLOSED LIPS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0139 WELL THE OLD FELLOWS POKED US AND FELT US AND PINCHED US TILL I THOUGHT THEY'D NEVER BE DONE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0140 THEN WHEN THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED A MOMENT A WRETCHED CAT GOT UP ON THE TABLE AND NEARLY ATE US
tis-20080416-tou-voy0141 LUCKILY THE OLD MEN TURNED ROUND IN TIME AND SHOOED HER AWAY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0142 YOU MAY BE SURE THOUGH THAT WE TOOK A COUPLE OF GOOD GULPS OF AIR WHILE THEY WEREN'T LOOKING AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0143 THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED US FROM CHOKING I WANTED TO WHISPER TO CLIPPA TO BE BRAVE AND STICK IT OUT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0144 BUT I COULDN'T EVEN DO THAT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW MOST KINDS OF FISH TALK CANNOT BE HEARD
tis-20080416-tou-voy0145 NOT EVEN A SHOUT UNLESS YOU'RE UNDER WATER THEN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0146 JUST AS WE WERE ABOUT TO GIVE IT UP AND LET ON THAT WE WERE ALIVE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0147 ONE OF THE OLD MEN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY LIFTED US UP AND CARRIED US OUT OF THE BUILDING
tis-20080416-tou-voy0148 NOW FOR IT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WE'LL SOON KNOW OUR FATE LIBERTY OR THE GARBAGE CAN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0149 OUTSIDE TO OUR UNSPEAKABLE HORROR HE MADE STRAIGHT FOR A LARGE ASH BARREL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0150 WHICH STOOD AGAINST THE WALL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A YARD MOST HAPPILY FOR US HOWEVER
tis-20080416-tou-voy0151 WHILE HE WAS CROSSING THIS YARD
tis-20080416-tou-voy0152 A VERY DIRTY MAN WITH A WAGON AND HORSES DROVE UP AND TOOK THE ASH BARREL AWAY I SUPPOSE IT WAS HIS PROPERTY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0153 THEN THE OLD MAN LOOKED AROUND FOR SOME OTHER PLACE TO THROW US
tis-20080416-tou-voy0154 HE SEEMED ABOUT TO CAST US UPON THE GROUND BUT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0155 HE EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD MAKE THE YARD UNTIDY AND HE DESISTED
tis-20080416-tou-voy0156 THE SUSPENSE WAS TERRIBLE HE MOVED OUTSIDE THE YARD GATE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0157 AND MY HEART SANK ONCE MORE AS I SAW THAT HE NOW INTENDED TO THROW US IN THE GUTTER OF THE ROADWAY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0158 BUT FORTUNE WAS INDEED WITH US THAT DAY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0159 A LARGE MAN IN BLUE CLOTHES AND SILVER BUTTONS STOPPED HIM IN THE NICK OF TIME
tis-20080416-tou-voy0160 EVIDENTLY FROM THE WAY THE LARGE MAN LECTURED AND WAVED A SHORT THICK STICK IT WAS AGAINST THE RULES OF THE TOWN TO THROW DEAD FISH IN THE STREETS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0161 AT LAST TO OUR UNUTTERABLE JOY THE OLD MAN TURNED AND MOVED OFF WITH US TOWARDS THE HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0162 HE WALKED SO SLOWLY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF ALL THE WAY AND WATCHING THE MAN IN BLUE OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE THAT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0163 I WANTED TO BITE HIS FINGER TO MAKE HIM HURRY UP
tis-20080416-tou-voy0164 BOTH CLIPPA AND I WERE ACTUALLY AT OUR LAST GASP FINALLY HE REACHED THE SEA WALL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0165 AND GIVING US ONE LAST SAD LOOK HE DROPPED US INTO THE WATERS OF THE HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0166 NEVER HAD WE REALIZED ANYTHING LIKE THE THRILL OF THAT MOMENT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0167 AS WE FELT THE SALT WETNESS CLOSE OVER OUR HEADS WITH ONE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0168 FLICK OF OUR TAILS WE CAME TO LIFE AGAIN THE OLD MAN WAS SO SURPRISED
tis-20080416-tou-voy0169 THAT HE FELL RIGHT INTO THE WATER ALMOST ON TOP OF US
tis-20080416-tou-voy0170 FROM THIS HE WAS RESCUED BY A SAILOR WITH A BOAT HOOK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0171 AND THE LAST WE SAW OF HIM THE MAN IN BLUE WAS DRAGGING HIM AWAY BY THE COAT COLLAR LECTURING HIM AGAIN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0172 APPARENTLY IT WAS ALSO AGAINST THE RULES OF THE TOWN TO THROW DEAD FISH INTO THE HARBOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0173 BUT WE WHAT TIME OR THOUGHT HAD WE FOR HIS TROUBLES WE WERE FREE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0174 IN LIGHTNING LEAPS IN CURVING SPURTS IN CRAZY ZIG ZAGS WHOOPING SHRIEKING WITH DELIGHT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0175 WE SPED FOR HOME AND THE OPEN SEA THAT IS ALL OF MY STORY AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0176 I WILL NOW AS I PROMISED LAST NIGHT TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY ASK ABOUT THE SEA
tis-20080416-tou-voy0177 ON CONDITION THAT I AM SET AT LIBERTY AS SOON AS YOU HAVE DONE THE DOCTOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0178 IS THERE ANY PART OF THE SEA DEEPER THAN THAT KNOWN AS THE NERO DEEP I MEAN THE ONE NEAR THE ISLAND OF GUAM
tis-20080416-tou-voy0179 THE FIDGIT WHY CERTAINLY THERE'S ONE MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE AMAZON RIVER
tis-20080416-tou-voy0180 BUT IT'S SMALL AND HARD TO FIND WE CALL IT THE DEEP HOLE AND THERE'S ANOTHER
tis-20080416-tou-voy0181 IN THE ANTARCTIC SEA THE DOCTOR CAN YOU TALK ANY SHELLFISH LANGUAGE YOURSELF THE FIDGIT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0182 NO NOT A WORD WE REGULAR FISHES DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SHELLFISH WE CONSIDER THEM A LOW CLASS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0183 THE DOCTOR BUT WHEN YOU'RE NEAR THEM CAN YOU HEAR THE SOUND THEY MAKE TALKING I MEAN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0184 WITHOUT NECESSARILY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY SAY THE FIDGIT ONLY WITH THE VERY LARGEST ONES
tis-20080416-tou-voy0185 SHELLFISH HAVE SUCH WEAK SMALL VOICES IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY BUT THEIR OWN KIND TO HEAR THEM
tis-20080416-tou-voy0186 BUT WITH THE BIGGER ONES IT IS DIFFERENT THEY MAKE A SAD BOOMING NOISE RATHER LIKE AN IRON PIPE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0187 BEING KNOCKED WITH A STONE ONLY NOT NEARLY SO LOUD OF COURSE THE DOCTOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0188 I AM MOST ANXIOUS TO GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA TO STUDY MANY THINGS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0189 BUT WE LAND ANIMALS AS YOU NO DOUBT KNOW ARE UNABLE TO BREATHE UNDER WATER
tis-20080416-tou-voy0190 HAVE YOU ANY IDEAS THAT MIGHT HELP ME THE FIDGIT I THINK THAT FOR BOTH YOUR DIFFICULTIES
tis-20080416-tou-voy0191 THE BEST THING FOR YOU TO DO WOULD BE TO TRY AND GET HOLD OF THE GREAT GLASS SEA SNAIL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0192 THE DOCTOR ER WHO OR WHAT IS THE GREAT GLASS SEA SNAIL THE FIDGIT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0193 HE IS AN ENORMOUS SALT WATER SNAIL ONE OF THE WINKLE FAMILY BUT AS LARGE AS A BIG HOUSE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0194 HE TALKS QUITE LOUDLY WHEN HE SPEAKS BUT THIS IS NOT OFTEN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0195 HE CAN GO TO ANY PART OF THE OCEAN AT ALL DEPTHS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0196 BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF ANY CREATURE IN THE SEA HIS SHELL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0197 IS MADE OF TRANSPARENT MOTHER O PEARL SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THROUGH IT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0198 BUT IT'S THICK AND STRONG WHEN HE IS OUT OF HIS SHELL AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0199 HE CARRIES IT EMPTY ON HIS BACK THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR A WAGON AND A PAIR OF HORSES
tis-20080416-tou-voy0200 HE HAS BEEN SEEN CARRYING HIS FOOD IN IT WHEN TRAVELING THE DOCTOR I
tis-20080416-tou-voy0201 FEEL THAT THAT IS JUST THE CREATURE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0202 HE COULD TAKE ME AND MY ASSISTANT INSIDE HIS SHELL AND WE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0203 COULD EXPLORE THE DEEPEST DEPTHS IN SAFETY DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET HIM FOR ME
tis-20080416-tou-voy0204 THE FIDGIT ALAS NO I WOULD WILLINGLY IF I COULD BUT HE IS HARDLY EVER SEEN BY ORDINARY FISH
tis-20080416-tou-voy0205 HE LIVES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEP HOLE AND SELDOM COMES OUT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0206 AND INTO THE DEEP HOLE THE LOWER WATERS OF WHICH ARE MUDDY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0207 FISHES SUCH AS WE ARE AFRAID TO GO THE DOCTOR DEAR ME THAT'S A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0208 ARE THERE MANY OF THIS KIND OF SNAIL IN THE SEA THE FIDGIT OH NO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0209 HE IS THE ONLY ONE IN EXISTENCE SINCE HIS SECOND WIFE DIED LONG LONG AGO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0210 HE IS THE LAST OF THE GIANT SHELLFISH HE BELONGS TO PAST AGES
tis-20080416-tou-voy0211 WHEN THE WHALES WERE LAND ANIMALS AND ALL THAT THEY SAY HE IS OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS OLD
tis-20080416-tou-voy0212 THE DOCTOR GOOD GRACIOUS WHAT WONDERFUL THINGS HE COULD TELL ME I DO WISH I COULD MEET HIM
tis-20080416-tou-voy0213 THE FIDGIT WERE THERE ANY MORE QUESTIONS YOU WISHED TO ASK ME
tis-20080416-tou-voy0214 THIS WATER IN YOUR TANK IS GETTING QUITE WARM AND SICKLY
tis-20080416-tou-voy0215 I'D LIKE TO BE PUT BACK INTO THE SEA AS SOON AS YOU CAN SPARE ME
tis-20080416-tou-voy0216 THE DOCTOR JUST ONE MORE THING WHEN CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS CROSSED THE ATLANTIC IN FOURTEEN NINETY TWO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0217 HE THREW OVERBOARD TWO COPIES OF HIS DIARY SEALED UP IN BARRELS ONE OF THEM WAS NEVER FOUND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0218 IT MUST HAVE SUNK I WOULD LIKE TO GET IT FOR MY LIBRARY DO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0219 YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE IT IS THE FIDGIT YES I DO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0220 THAT TOO IS IN THE DEEP HOLE WHEN THE BARREL SANK THE CURRENTS DRIFTED IT NORTHWARDS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0221 DOWN WHAT WE CALL THE ORINOCO SLOPE TILL IT FINALLY DISAPPEARED INTO THE DEEP HOLE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0222 IF IT WAS ANY OTHER PART OF THE SEA I'D TRY AND GET IT FOR YOU
tis-20080416-tou-voy0223 BUT NOT THERE THE DOCTOR WELL THAT IS ALL I THINK
tis-20080416-tou-voy0224 I HATE TO PUT YOU BACK INTO THE SEA BECAUSE I KNOW THAT AS SOON AS I DO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0225 I'LL THINK OF A HUNDRED OTHER QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK YOU BUT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0226 I MUST KEEP MY PROMISE WOULD YOU CARE FOR ANYTHING BEFORE YOU GO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0227 IT SEEMS A COLD DAY SOME CRACKER CRUMBS OR SOMETHING THE FIDGIT NO I WON'T STOP
tis-20080416-tou-voy0228 ALL I WANT JUST AT PRESENT IS FRESH SEA WATER THE DOCTOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0229 I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR ALL THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
tis-20080416-tou-voy0230 YOU HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND PATIENT THE FIDGIT PRAY DO NOT MENTION IT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0231 IT HAS BEEN A REAL PLEASURE TO BE OF ASSISTANCE TO THE GREAT JOHN DOLITTLE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0232 YOU ARE AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW ALREADY QUITE FAMOUS AMONG THE BETTER CLASS OF FISHES
tis-20080416-tou-voy0233 GOODBYE AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU TO YOUR SHIP AND TO ALL YOUR PLANS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0234 THE DOCTOR CARRIED THE LISTENING TANK TO A PORTHOLE OPENED IT AND EMPTIED THE TANK INTO THE SEA
tis-20080416-tou-voy0235 GOOD BYE HE MURMURED AS A FAINT SPLASH REACHED US FROM WITHOUT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0236 I DROPPED MY PENCIL ON THE TABLE AND LEANED BACK WITH A SIGH
tis-20080416-tou-voy0237 MY FINGERS WERE SO STIFF WITH WRITERS CRAMP
tis-20080416-tou-voy0238 THAT I FELT AS THOUGH I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO OPEN MY HAND AGAIN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0239 BUT I AT LEAST HAD HAD A NIGHT'S SLEEP AS FOR THE POOR DOCTOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0240 HE WAS SO WEARY THAT HE HAD HARDLY PUT THE TANK BACK UPON THE TABLE AND DROPPED INTO A CHAIR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0241 WHEN HIS EYES CLOSED AND HE BEGAN TO SNORE IN THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0242 POLYNESIA SCRATCHED ANGRILY AT THE DOOR I ROSE AND LET HER IN
tis-20080416-tou-voy0243 A NICE STATE OF AFFAIRS SHE STORMED WHAT SORT OF A SHIP IS THIS
tis-20080416-tou-voy0244 THERE'S THAT COLORED MAN UPSTAIRS ASLEEP UNDER THE WHEEL THE DOCTOR ASLEEP DOWN HERE
tis-20080416-tou-voy0245 AND YOU MAKING POT HOOKS IN A COPY BOOK WITH A PENCIL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0246 EXPECT THE SHIP TO STEER HERSELF TO BRAZIL WE'RE JUST DRIFTING AROUND THE SEA LIKE AN EMPTY BOTTLE AND
tis-20080416-tou-voy0247 A WEEK BEHIND TIME AS IT IS WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU ALL
tis-20080416-tou-voy0248 SHE WAS SO ANGRY THAT HER VOICE ROSE TO A SCREAM BUT
tis-20080416-tou-voy0249 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MORE THAN THAT TO WAKE THE DOCTOR
tis-20080416-tou-voy0250 I PUT THE NOTE BOOK CAREFULLY IN A DRAWER AND WENT ON DECK TO
tis-20080416-tou-voy0251 TAKE THE WHEEL END OF CHAPTER TWO
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
tkelley353-20090430-bti-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
tkelley353-20090430-hxn-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
tkelley353-20090430-zof-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
tkelley353-20090430-zof-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
tkelley353-20090430-zof-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
tkelley353-20090430-zof-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
tkelley353-20090430-zof-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
tkelley353-20090430-zof-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
tkelley353-20090430-zof-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
tkelley353-20090430-zof-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
tkelley353-20090430-zof-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
tkelley353-20090430-zof-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0344 LOTS OF MEN TAKE WOMEN BUGGY RIDING
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0345 DAYLIGHT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM
tkelley353-20090501-bxj-b0346 THERE'S NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0293 THEY WERE DEEP IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0294 HE HAD BEEN FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0295 AND TWENTY MEN COULD HOLD IT WITH SPEARS AND ARROWS
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
tkelley353-20090501-qsf-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
toddh-20111105-lgw-b0231 WHAT'S THAT GRUB THIEF GOT TO DO WITH IT
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
toddh-20111105-pbd-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
topherfangio-20080604-dgk-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
topherfangio-20080604-edr-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
topherfangio-20080604-edr-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
topherfangio-20080604-edr-b0536 TYPHOID  DID I TELL YOU
topherfangio-20080604-edr-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
topherfangio-20080604-edr-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
topherfangio-20080604-edr-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
topherfangio-20080604-edr-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
topherfangio-20080604-edr-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
topherfangio-20080604-edr-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
topherfangio-20080604-edr-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0473 THE NIGHT WAS CALM AND SNOWY
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0474 I SAILED THIRD MATE IN THE LITTLE VAMPIRE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0475 HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM DROPPED TO HIS SIDE AND HE PAUSED
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0476 AT THIS MOMENT I FELT A STIR AT MY SHOULDER
topherfangio-20080604-egr-a0477 WADA LOUIS AND THE STEWARD ARE SERVANTS OF ASIATIC BREED
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
topherfangio-20080604-ejv-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
topherfangio-20080604-fcf-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-feu-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0577 ONCE THE JEWS HARP BEGAN EMITTING ITS BARBARIC RHYTHMS MICHAEL WAS HELPLESS
topherfangio-20080604-fvf-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
topherfangio-20080604-hkl-b0298 HIS HAND SHOT OUT AND CLUTCHED CROOKED LEG BY THE NECK
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
topherfangio-20080604-imo-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
topherfangio-20080604-ira-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0104 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0105 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0106 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0107 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
topherfangio-20080604-jvb-a0108 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0276 OOLONG ATOLL WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0277 MCCOY FOUND A STIFLING POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IN THE PENT CABIN
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0278 IT WOULD GIVE ME NERVOUS PROSTRATION
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0279 SHE SAID WITH CHATTERING TEETH
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
topherfangio-20080604-kzc-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
topherfangio-20080604-nan-a0292 HERE IN THE MIDMORNING THE FIRST CASUALTY OCCURRED
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0442 HE HAD BECOME A MAN VERY EARLY IN LIFE
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0443 I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE SO EARLY
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0444 HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN THE MINDS OF HIS SUPERIORS
topherfangio-20080604-nhn-b0445 MOPS SIR EAGERLY ANSWERED THE SAILOR AT THE WHEEL
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
topherfangio-20080604-nnk-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0501 YOU'RE JOKING ME SIR THE OTHER MANAGED TO ARTICULATE
topherfangio-20080604-nvd-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
topherfangio-20080604-ojg-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
topherfangio-20080604-qut-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
topherfangio-20080604-rrw-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
topherfangio-20080604-sci-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
topherfangio-20080604-spf-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
topherfangio-20080604-sxs-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-ar-22 IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-ar-23 IN THE FOGGY MORNING SOME MEN WITH SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RODE UP AND LOOKED AT THE BARN
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
topherfangio-20080604-tgh-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
topherfangio-20080604-tjf-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
topherfangio-20080604-trp-a0316 WE HAD BEEN CHASED BY THEM OURSELVES MORE THAN ONCE
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0023 MACDOUGALL MY ENGINEER BELIEVES IT
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0024 IT IS GROWING EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0025 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0026 YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THESE MEN
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0027 AND THERE'S NO CHIVALRY NO QUARTER SHOWN IN THIS FIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0028 LORD FITZHUGH IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE SITUATION
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0029 ALL OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FROM MONTREAL AND TORONTO
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
topherfangio-20080604-twl-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
topherfangio-20080604-wvs-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0281 JUST THE SAME I'D SOONER BE MYSELF THAN HAVE BOOK INDIGESTION
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0282 SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN RUPTURED
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
topherfangio-20080604-wyz-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
topherfangio-20080604-xmp-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0411 HE GAVE NO REASON BUT HIS MOTIVE WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
toshihide-20100502-drx-b0412 AH IT WAS SWEET IN MY EARS
tristau-20090801-jli-b0457 AND SALVATION
tristau-20090801-jli-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
tristau-20090801-jli-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
tristau-20090801-jli-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
tristau-20090801-jli-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
tristau-20090801-jli-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
tristau-20090801-jli-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
tristau-20090801-jli-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
tristau-20090801-jli-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
tristau-20090801-jli-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
tristau-20090801-txl-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
tristau-20090801-txl-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
tristau-20090801-txl-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
tristau-20090801-txl-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
tristau-20090801-txl-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
tristau-20090801-txl-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
tristau-20090801-txl-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
tristau-20090801-txl-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
tristau-20090801-txl-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
tristau-20090801-txl-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
tristau-20090801-vnx-b0323 CRICKETS BEGAN TO CHIRP AND MORE GEESE AND DUCKS FLEW OVERHEAD
tristau-20090801-whn-a0458 STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
tristau-20090801-whn-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
tristau-20090801-whn-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
tristau-20090801-whn-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
tristau-20090801-whn-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
tristau-20090801-whn-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
tristau-20090801-whn-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
tristau-20090801-whn-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
tristau-20090801-whn-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
tristau-20090801-whn-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0279 WITH CHATTERING TEETH
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0280 I'LL BE OUT OF MY HEAD IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0281 I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING REMEMBER THAT
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE  BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
tristau-20090801-wrv-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
tristau-20090801-xxp-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
trrichar-20130915-xng-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0196 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0197 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0198 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
tsmock-20110613-thv-a0199 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
tsmock-20110613-zmu-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
tsmock-20111112-aee-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
tsmock-20111112-ava-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
tsmock-20120308-ltq-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0180 I I BEG PARDON HE DRAWLED
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
tsmock-20120308-xrl-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
tsmock-20120308-zuk-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0165 THEY ARE GOING TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
tsmock-20120701-qts-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
tsmock-20120703-pgs-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
tsmock-20120703-ytp-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
tsmock-20120704-aie-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
tsmock-20120705-zdm-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0582 DAUGHTRY ELABORATED ON THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID
tsmock-20120707-dki-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
tsmock-20120707-mbv-a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0259 THINK OF INVESTING IN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0260 NOBODY KNEW HIS HISTORY THEY OF THE JUNTA LEAST OF ALL
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0261 I HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BAPTIZED
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0262 THEY WOULDN'T BE SWEEPING A BIG VESSEL LIKE THE MARTHA
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0263 JOAN LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT SHELDON WHO BOWED
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
tsmock-20120707-moo-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
tsmock-20120707-pbk-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
tsmock-20120707-sdu-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
tsmock-20120707-shn-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
tsmock-20120716-ulk-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
tsmock-20120716-ysn-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
tsmock-20120719-ccb-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
tsmock-20120719-ccb-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE
tsmock-20120719-get-a0264 AND I HOPE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF CHAIN OUT CAPTAIN YOUNG
tsmock-20120719-get-a0265 THE DISCOVERY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
tsmock-20120719-get-a0266 THEY HANDLED TWO MEN ALREADY BOTH GRUB THIEVES
tsmock-20120719-get-a0267 ELI HARDING ASKED AS SHUNK STARTED TO FOLLOW
tsmock-20120719-get-a0268 NOW GO AHEAD AND TELL ME IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WHAT HAS HAPPENED
tsmock-20120719-get-a0269 THAT'S WHERE THEY CUT OFF THE SCOTTISH CHIEFS AND KILLED ALL HANDS
tsmock-20120719-get-a0270 AND AFTER THE BATH A SHAVE WOULD NOT BE BAD
tsmock-20120719-get-a0271 NOW PLEASE GIVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHAT OCCURRED
tsmock-20120719-get-a0272 YOU CAN TAKE A VACATION ON PAY
tsmock-20120719-get-a0273 THEY ARE BIG TREES AND REQUIRE PLENTY OF ROOM
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
tsmock-20120719-gpy-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
tsmock-20120719-ids-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0522 FOR SUCH COUNTRIES NOTHING REMAINED BUT REORGANIZATION
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0523 THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE THEIR METHOD OF PRODUCING SURPLUSES
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0524 AT ONCE WOULD BE INSTITUTED A DOZEN COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH STATES
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0525 THE OLIGARCHY WANTED VIOLENCE AND IT SET ITS AGENTS PROVOCATEURS TO WORK
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
tsmock-20120719-ljp-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0490 WHAT AN EXCITED WHISPERING AND CONFERRING TOOK PLACE
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
tsmock-20120719-nfc-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
tsmock-20120719-rlx-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
tsmock-20120719-xfc-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0329 AH INDEED
tsmock-20120719-yev-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
tsmock-20120720-wul-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
tsmock-20120720-wul-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
tsmock-20120720-wul-a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
tsmock-20120720-wul-a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
tsmock-20120720-wul-b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
tsmock-20120720-wul-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
tsmock-20120720-wul-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
tsmock-20120720-wul-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
tsmock-20120720-wul-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
tsmock-20120720-wul-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
tsmock-20120722-gsn-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA

tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
tsmock-20120722-hjf-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL

tsmock-20120722-hnt-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
tsmock-20120722-hnt-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
tsmock-20120722-hnt-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
tsmock-20120722-hnt-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
tsmock-20120722-hnt-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
tsmock-20120722-hnt-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
tsmock-20120722-vca-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
tsmock-20120722-vca-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID

tsmock-20120722-vca-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
tsmock-20120722-vca-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
tsmock-20120722-vca-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
tsmock-20120722-vca-a0185 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
tsmock-20120722-vca-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
tsmock-20120722-vca-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
tsmock-20120722-yvt-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
tsmock-20120724-apd-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
tsmock-20120724-apd-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
tsmock-20120724-apd-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS

tsmock-20120724-apd-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
tsmock-20120724-apd-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
tsmock-20120724-apd-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
tsmock-20120724-apd-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
tsmock-20120724-mcz-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
tsmock-20120724-mcz-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY

tsmock-20120806-gfu-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
tsmock-20120806-hlo-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
tsmock-20120806-hmu-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
tsmock-20120806-hrw-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0329 AH INDEED
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
tsmock-20120806-uoa-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
tsmock-20120806-vpt-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
tsmock-20120813-uvo-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
tsmock-20120815-jlr-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
tsmock-20120930-jyf-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0030 GREGSON HELD A LIGHTED MATCH UNTIL IT BURNT HIS FINGERTIPS
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0031 GREGSON HAD SEATED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAMP AND WAS SHARPENING A PENCIL
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0032 HE CAUGHT HIMSELF WITH A JERK
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0033 HOW DOES YOUR WAGER LOOK NOW
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0034 HE CONFESSED THAT THE SKETCH HAD STARTLED HIM
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
tsmock-20120930-uyi-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
tsmock-20121014-uyq-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0182 I WAS IN NEW YORK WHEN THE CRASH CAME
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0183 NO I DID NOT FALL AMONG THIEVES
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0184 SUCH THINGS IN HER BRAIN WERE LIKE SO MANY OATHS ON HER LIPS
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0185 YOUR BEING WRECKED HERE HAS BEEN A GODSEND TO ME
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0186 I CAN'T GO ELSEWHERE BY YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0187 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WITH COCOANUTS WERE A REVELATION
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0188 HE GLANCED DOWN AT HER HELPLESSLY AND MOISTENED HIS LIPS
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0189 THAT IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES ALL OF US FROM THE LOWER ANIMALS
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0190 IDEALISM LED HIM TO PHILOSOPHIC ANARCHY AND HIS FAMILY THREW HIM OFF
tsmock-20121207-akg-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
tsmock-20121207-dwx-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN IMPULSE A POET
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
tsmock-20121207-osi-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0106 FOR A FULL MINUTE THE TWO MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0107 HE WAS SURE NOW OF BUT FEW THINGS
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0108 IT WAS A MIRACLE AND I OWE YOU MY LIFE
tsmock-20121213-jgc-b0109 PHILIP ATE LIGHTLY OF THE FOOD WHICH PIERRE HAD READY FOR HIM
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
tsmock-20121213-qwt-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0501 AND WHEREVER I RANGED THE WAY LAY ALONG ALCOHOL DRENCHED ROADS
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0502 AND AS WE HURRIED UP TOWN JOE GOOSE EXPLAINED
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0503 THE SCENTS OF STRANGE VEGETATION BLEW OFF THE TROPIC LAND
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0504 THE LIFE THERE WAS HEALTHFUL AND ATHLETIC BUT TOO JUVENILE
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0505 HOW VALIANTLY I WENT AT IT THAT FIRST DAY
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
tsmock-20121213-swe-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0191 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT BETTER CONFIDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BY CARRYING NO WEAPONS
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0192 OUTSIDERS ARE ALLOWED FIVE MINUTE SPEECHES THE SICK MAN URGED
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0193 SO WAS PACKARD'S FINISH SUICIDE
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0194 JOAN CRIED WITH SHINING EYES
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0195 NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE NATIVES GOT THEM
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0196 HOW CAN YOU MANAGE ALL ALONE MR YOUNG
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0197 THE PLANTERS ARE ALREADY CONSIDERING THE MATTER
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0198 I USE GREAT TROUBLE ADVISEDLY
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0199 DEAR SIR YOUR SECOND VICTIM HAS FALLEN ON SCHEDULE TIME
tsmock-20121213-utq-b0200 WE LEAVE THE EVENTUALITY TO TIME AND LAW
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
tsmock-20121215-gtn-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
tsmock-20130610-orj-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
tsmock-20130610-orj-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME

tsmock-20130610-orj-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
tsmock-20130610-orj-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
tsmock-20130610-orj-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
tsmock-20130610-orj-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
tsmock-20130610-orj-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
tsmock-20130610-orj-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
tsmock-20130622-aho-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE

tsmock-20130622-etj-a0006 GOD BLESS EM I HOPE I'LL GO ON SEEING THEM FOREVER
tsmock-20130622-etj-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
tsmock-20130622-etj-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
tsmock-20130622-etj-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
tsmock-20130622-etj-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
tsmock-20130622-etj-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
tsmock-20130622-etj-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
tsmock-20130622-etj-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
tsmock-20130622-etj-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0526 NOWHERE DID THE RAW EARTH APPEAR
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0527 THE LUSH VEGETATION OF THAT SHELTERED SPOT MAKE A NATURAL SHIELD
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0528 MEN WHO ENDURE IT CALL IT LIVING DEATH
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0529 AS I SAY HE HAD TAPPED THE MESSAGE VERY RAPIDLY
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0530 ASK HIM I LAUGHED THEN TURNED TO PASQUINI
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0531 IN WHAT BUCOLIC SCHOOL OF FENCE HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT WAS BEYOND IMAGINING
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0532 MAY DROUGHT DESTROY YOUR CROPS
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0533 DUNHAM CAN YOUR BOY GO ALONG WITH JESSE
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0534 BUT JOHANNES COULD AND DID
tsmock-20130720-pgq-a0535 A NEW PREACHER AND A NEW DOCTRINE COME TO JERUSALEM
tsmock-20140713-jau-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
tsmock-20140713-jau-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
tsmock-20140713-jau-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
tsmock-20140713-jau-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING

tsmock-20140713-jau-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
tsmock-20140713-jau-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
tsmock-20140713-jau-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
tsmock-20140713-jau-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED

turtleman-20130413-zhx-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
turtleman-20130413-zhx-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
turtleman-20130413-zhx-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
turtleman-20130413-zhx-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
turtleman-20130413-zhx-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
turtleman-20130413-zhx-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
turtleman-20130621-xjz-ar-01 ONCE THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO NEVER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
turtleman-20130621-xjz-ar-02 WHENEVER HIS FRIENDS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH THEM
turtleman-20130621-xjz-ar-03 HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER I DON'T KNOW HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER
turtleman-20130621-xjz-ar-04 HE WOULD ALWAYS SHIRK MAKING A CHOICE HIS AUNT HELEN SAID TO HIM
turtleman-20130621-xjz-rp-26 SUPER IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
turtleman-20130621-xjz-rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
turtleman-20130621-xjz-rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
turtleman-20130621-xjz-rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
turtleman-20130621-xjz-rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
turtleman-20130621-xjz-rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE

uklebot-20090813-jub-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
uklebot-20090813-jub-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
uklebot-20090813-jub-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
uklebot-20090813-jub-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
uklebot-20090813-jub-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
uklebot-20090813-yez-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE

uklebot-20090813-zxl-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
uklebot-20090813-zxl-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
uklebot-20090813-zxl-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
uklebot-20090813-zxl-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
uklebot-20090813-zxl-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
uklebot-20090813-zxl-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS
uklebot-20090813-zxl-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
uklebot-20090813-zxl-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
ulor-20100711-uov-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
ulor-20100711-uov-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
ulor-20100711-uov-b0278 NOW ANIMALS DO NOT LIKE MOCKERY
ulor-20100711-uov-b0279 HE GAVE ONE LAST SNARL AND SLID FROM VIEW AMONG THE TREES
ulor-20100711-uov-b0280 AGAIN THE GIRLS APPLAUDED AND MRS HALL CRIED

ulor-20100711-uov-b0283 BUT WE WERE WITHOUT THIS MOMENTUM
ulor-20100711-uov-b0284 THERE WAS ONE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER
ulor-20100711-uov-b0285 THE HYENA PROCEEDED TO DINE
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON

unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-bvx-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
unbridledrage-20090106-clj-b0172 ON THE FAR CORNER OF THE COMPOUND FENCE A HAWK BROODED
unbridledrage-20090106-clj-b0173 TO THESE HE GAVE CASTOR OIL
unbridledrage-20090106-clj-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
unbridledrage-20090106-clj-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
unbridledrage-20090106-clj-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
unbridledrage-20090106-clj-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING

unbridledrage-20090106-clj-b0181 AND YOU PREFERRED A CANNIBAL ISLE AND A CARTRIDGE BELT
unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0349 IN SUCH A TUMBLING OF VALUES WAS NO TIME TO SELL
unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0350 STAND OFF BUTCHER AND BAKER AND ALL THE REST

unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0352 NOW JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0353 I WANT TO KNOW HOW ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE
unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0354 IT'S THAT MUCH JUNK
unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0355 THERE WAS PROPER DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE WORK THEY INDIVIDUALLY PERFORMED
unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0356 HE LOVED TO PLAY CHINESE LOTTERY
unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0357 THE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG
unbridledrage-20090106-dho-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
unbridledrage-20090106-drs-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-dwk-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
unbridledrage-20090106-fzs-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
unbridledrage-20090106-gej-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0051 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0052 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0053 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0054 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
unbridledrage-20090106-han-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0306 HE WAS PRESSING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS VOCABULARY
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0307 VERY EARLY IN MY LIFE I SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0308 HIS INFERNAL CHATTERING WORRIES ME EVEN NOW AS I THINK OF IT
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0309 WHITE LEGHORNS SAID MRS MORTIMER
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0310 MASSAGE UNDER TENSION WAS THE CRYPTIC REPLY
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0311 THEREFORE HURRAH FOR THE GAME
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0312 IT LIVED IN PERPETUAL APPREHENSION OF THAT QUARTER OF THE COMPASS
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0313 BROKEN TOOTH YELLED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0314 THUS WAS MOMENTUM GAINED IN THE YOUNGER WORLD
unbridledrage-20090106-hpf-a0315 SAXON WAITED FOR SHE KNEW A FRESH IDEA HAD STRUCK BILLY
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0274 FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT A HARSH VOICE SAID
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0275 BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT LONG
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0276 WE WERE NOW GOOD FRIENDS
unbridledrage-20090106-ifx-b0277 TWO OF THE FOLK WERE ALREADY UP
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0186 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0187 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0188 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0189 THE BIG EYED CLUCKING MOOSE BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0190 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0191 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0192 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0193 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0194 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
unbridledrage-20090106-kcf-a0195 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0335 RED EYE SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON THE BRANCH FARTHER DOWN
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0336 SO UNEXPECTED WAS MY CHARGE THAT I KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0337 ENCOURAGED BY MY CONDUCT BIG FACE BECAME A SUDDEN ALLY
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
unbridledrage-20090106-koj-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl-b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
unbridledrage-20090106-meb-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
unbridledrage-20090106-mqp-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
unbridledrage-20090106-ton-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0558 AND THE FOUNDATION STONE OF SERVICE IN HIS CASE WAS OBEDIENCE
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0559 PEACE BE UNTO YOU AND GRACE BEFORE THE LORD
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
unbridledrage-20090106-toy-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0531 I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ADVENTURE
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0532 THAT LONGFELLOW CHAP MOST LIKELY HAD WRITTEN COUNTLESS BOOKS OF POETRY
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
unbridledrage-20090106-uco-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0296 BASSETT WAS A FASTIDIOUS MAN
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0297 THERE'S A BIG ENGLISH GENERAL RIGHT NOW WHOSE NAME IS ROBERTS
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0298 THIS TACIT PROMISE OF CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE GAVE SAXON A LITTLE JOY THRILL
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0299 I TELL YOU I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS ADVENTURE TOMFOOLERY AND ROT
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0300 FROM MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION MY SLEEP WAS A PERIOD OF TERROR
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0301 BUT ALL MY DREAMS VIOLATED THIS LAW
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0302 IT IS VERY PLAUSIBLE TO SUCH PEOPLE A MOST CONVINCING HYPOTHESIS
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0303 BUT THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF IGNORING THEIR OWN DUALITY
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0304 I GRADUATED LAST OF MY CLASS
unbridledrage-20090106-xfo-a0305 THEY HAD NO FIXED VALUES TO BE ALTERED BY ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0438 AT SEA MONDAY MARCH SIXTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0439 AT SEA WEDNESDAY MARCH EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0440 YES SIR I CORRECTED
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
unbridledrage-20090106-zzt-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
vandev1-20140401-dkn-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
vandev1-20140401-ffc-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0117 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0118 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0119 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0120 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0121 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0122 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
vandev1-20140401-lon-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0393 I WAS STILL WEAK FROM MY PROLONGED IMMERSION
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0394 THE BOY HESITATED THEN MASTERED HIS TEMPER
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0395 I WAS BENEATH THE WATER SUFFOCATING AND DROWNING
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0396 THE PAIN FROM MY HURT KNEE WAS AGONIZING
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0397 THE HUNTERS WERE STILL ARGUING AND ROARING LIKE SOME SEMI HUMAN AMPHIBIOUS BREED
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0398 I HAVE BEEN ROBBED SIR I AMENDED
vandev1-20140401-ytt-b0399 YOU WERE LOOKING SQUEAMISH THIS AFTERNOON HE BEGAN
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
vertago1-20090805-dka-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0204 THE WOLF DOG THRUST HIS GAUNT MUZZLE TOWARD HIM
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
vertago1-20090805-ead-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
vertago1-20090805-efa-rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
vertago1-20090805-hyu-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
vertago1-20090805-mda-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0233 I NEVER ALLOW WHAT CAN'T BE CHANGED TO ANNOY ME
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0234 WHY THE AVERAGE REVIEW IS MORE NAUSEATING THAN COD LIVER OIL
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0235 HIS VOICE WAS PASSIONATELY REBELLIOUS
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0236 DON'T YOU SEE I HATE YOU
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0237 SO HUGHIE AND I DID THE MANAGING OURSELVES
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0238 IT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE GALLINA SOCIETY IN OAKLAND ONE AFTERNOON
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0239 HE CRIED IN SUCH GENUINE DISMAY THAT SHE BROKE INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
vertago1-20090805-mfz-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-17 YOU ARE COMING OF COURSE I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-18 THE ROOF MAY NOT COME DOWN YET
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-19 WELL SAID THE OLD RAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO JOIN US RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-20 ARTHUR STOOD AND WATCHED THEM HURRY AWAY
vertago1-20090805-qla-ar-21 I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID CALMLY TO HIMSELF BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0527 THE VERY IDEA OF IT WAS PREPOSTEROUS
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0528 CAPTAIN DOANE'S ORDERS WERE SWIFTLY OBEYED
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0529 COME ON DEL MAR CHALLENGED
vertago1-20090805-qrc-b0530 HE HAD A BIG CHIMPANZEE THAT WAS A WINNER
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
vikasrij-20130111-bhz-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0370 AND NOW BEHOLD THE PERVERSITY OF THINGS
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0371 YIELD YOURSELF TO THE WATERS THAT ARE RIPPING AND TEARING AT YOU
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0372 MR MCVEIGH TOLD ME ABOUT HIM
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
volkerbradley-20121230-nsg-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0238 THE VERY THOUGHT OF THE EFFORT TO SWIM OVER WAS NAUSEATING
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0239 AND THERE WAS A DOG THAT BARKED
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0240 THERE ARE FOUR ALL LOW MCCOY ANSWERED
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0241 THE WOMEN THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM TO THE BIG VALLEY
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
volkerbradley-20121230-prd-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
volkerbradley-20121230-pwh-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
volkerbradley-20121230-snc-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
volkerbradley-20121230-xlt-b0392 YES SIR HE ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL ALACRITY
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0401 I LEARNED IT MYSELF IN ENGLISH SHIPS
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0402 AN ALTRUISTIC ACT IS AN ACT PERFORMED FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0403 KNOWING HIM I REVIEW THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN MYTHS WITH CLEARER UNDERSTANDING
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0404 YES AND NO SIR WAS THE SLOW REPLY
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0405 AND EACH YEAR SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I DID NOT GO
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0406 HOW IN HELL DID HE KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE DARK
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0407 OF COURSE MUCH GRUMBLING WENT ON AND LITTLE OUTBURSTS WERE CONTINUALLY OCCURRING
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0408 YOU HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGE
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0409 THE DIRK MENTIONED BY WOLF LARSEN RESTED IN ITS SHEATH ON MY HIP
volkerbradley-20121230-zrd-b0410 HAVE YOU EVER EARNED A DOLLAR BY YOUR OWN LABOUR
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
volkerbradley-20121231-nrj-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0318 PRODUCTION IS DOUBLING AND QUADRUPLING UPON ITSELF
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0319 AND THE EDINBURGH EVENING NEWS SAYS WITH EDITORIAL GLOOM
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0320 WITH MY STRENGTH I SLAMMED IT FULL INTO RED EYE'S FACE
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0321 THE LOG ON WHICH LOP EAR WAS LYING GOT ADRIFT
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
volkerbradley-20121231-zli-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0350 IS THAT PAT HANRAHAN'S MUG LOOKING HUNGRY AND WILLING
volkerbradley-20130102-myz-a0351 IT WAS MORE LIKE SUGAR
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0205 FROM NOW ON WE'RE PALS
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0206 HE SAYS HE BOUGHT HIM OF JACQUES LE BEAU
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0207 HOW MUCH WAS IT
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0208 YOUTH HAD COME BACK TO HER FREED FROM THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
volkerbradley-20130102-sal-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0162 THAT'S THE SUB FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
vorcollion-20091013-stb-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
vschum-20090719-dob-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
vschum-20090719-dob-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
vschum-20090719-dob-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
vschum-20090719-dob-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
vschum-20090719-dob-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
vschum-20090719-dob-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
vschum-20090719-dob-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
vschum-20090719-dob-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
vschum-20090719-dob-a0048 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
vschum-20090719-dob-a0049 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE ENTERED THE CABIN
vschum-20090719-hak-a0123 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
vschum-20090719-hak-a0124 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
vschum-20090719-hak-a0125 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
vschum-20090719-hak-a0126 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
vschum-20090719-hak-a0127 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
vschum-20090719-hak-a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
vschum-20090719-hak-a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
vschum-20090719-hak-a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
vschum-20090719-hak-a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
vschum-20090719-hak-a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
vschum-20090719-hfr-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
vschum-20090719-ktq-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO CALLED VOICE DIALING
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
vschum-20090719-rjj-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0342 EACH IMPROVEMENT MAKES THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE PUMP UP
vschum-20110103-aqz-b0343 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
vschum-20120224-wpn-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0506 IT WOULD HELP TO TIDE ME ALONG UNTIL I GOT STEADY EMPLOYMENT
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0507 DID I POSSESS TOO MUCH VITALITY
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0508 IN HIS ANXIETY AND SOLICITUDE AND LOVE THEY DID NOT COUNT
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0514 TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY IT MIGHT HE GONE
wajkordanii-20081116-ggv-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF

wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0469 VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LAW
wesjackson-20130502-kky-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0538 WHAT PASCAL GLIMPSED WITH THE VISION OF A SEER I HAVE LIVED
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0539 I SHOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE JUST FOR ONE WHOLE LIFE IN THAT
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0540 YEA SO ARE ALL THE LESSER ANIMALS OF TODAY CLEAN
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
wesjackson-20130502-yeo-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0282 IF YOU MEAN TO INSINUATE BRENTWOOD BEGAN HOTLY
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0283 THE WOMAN IN YOU IS ONLY INCIDENTAL ACCIDENTAL AND IRRELEVANT
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0284 THERE WAS NO FORECASTING THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PROCESSES
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0285 BUT WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0286 GIVE THEM THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN A FINE OR AN OFFICIAL WHIPPING
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0287 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0288 THOSE ARE MY OYSTERS HE SAID AT LAST
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0289 THEY ARE NOT REGULAR OYSTER PIRATES NICHOLAS CONTINUED
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0290 ONE BY ONE THE BOYS WERE CAPTURED
wheel_of_fire-20110405-bkh-a0291 THE WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND NO OVERT ACTS HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0418 THE PORTUGUESE BOY CRAWLED NEARER AND NEARER
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0419 THE PORTUGUESE BOY PASSED THE HAWAIIAN
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0420 WHEN I CAME TO I WAS WAVING MY HAT AND MURMURING ECSTATICALLY
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0421 BY GOLLY THE BOY WINS
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0422 HALFWAY AROUND THE TRACK ONE DONKEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH ITS RIDER
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0423 MCVEIGH WHEN HE RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HONOLULU
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0424 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DISEASE THAT COULD BE CONTRACTED BY CONTACT
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0425 OTHERWISE NO RESTRICTION IS PUT UPON THEIR SEAFARING
wheel_of_fire-20110405-ddf-a0426 THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME OF INCUBATION
wsloand-20111229-fqk-a0593 SHE'D MAKE A GOOD WIFE FOR THE CASHIER
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0001 GAD DO I REMEMBER IT
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
wsloand-20111229-fqk-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0071 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0072 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0073 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0074 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0075 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0076 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0077 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
wsloand-20111229-ogp-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
xaviergonz-20080419-myf-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0399 AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0400 MANUEL HAD ONE BESETTING SIN
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0401 THE MAN SMILED GRIMLY AND BROUGHT A HATCHET AND A CLUB
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0402 CURLY RUSHED HER ANTAGONIST WHO STRUCK AGAIN AND LEAPED ASIDE
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0403 HIS NEWBORN CUNNING GAVE HIM POISE AND CONTROL
xaviergonz-20080419-uje-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
xaviergonz-20080419-vmv-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
yoyology-20130628-enc-b0533 HIS ABNORMAL POWER OF VISION MADE ABSTRACTIONS TAKE ON CONCRETE FORM
yoyology-20130628-enc-b0534 I'LL TELL YOU THE LIBRARIAN SAID WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE
yoyology-20130628-enc-b0535 HE READ HIS FRAGMENTS ALOUD
yoyology-20130628-enc-b0536 TYPHOID DID I TELL YOU
yoyology-20130628-enc-b0537 BUT SHE HAD BECOME AN AUTOMATON
yoyology-20130628-enc-b0538 AT THE BEST THEY WERE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES
yoyology-20130628-enc-b0539 YOU WERE MAKING THEM TALK SHOP RUTH CHARGED HIM
yoyology-20130628-enc-rp-01 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
yoyology-20130628-enc-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
yoyology-20130628-enc-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
yoyology-20130628-uce-a0070 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE

zcarrell-20130728-aji-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
zcarrell-20130728-aji-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS

zhihuich-20130615-xey-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
zhihuich-20130615-xey-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
zhihuich-20130615-xey-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
zhihuich-20130615-xey-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
zhihuich-20130615-xey-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
zhihuich-20130615-xey-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD

zlp-20100110-jmb-a0338 THE FIGHTING HAD NOW BECOME INTERMITTENT
zlp-20100110-jmb-a0339 THEY OBEYED HIM AND WENT HERE AND THERE AT HIS COMMANDS
zlp-20100110-jmb-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS

zlp-20100110-jwa-ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
zlp-20100110-jwa-ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
zlp-20100110-jwa-ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
zlp-20100110-jwa-ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
zlp-20100110-jwa-ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
zlp-20100110-kgx-a0322 THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF US
zlp-20100110-kgx-a0323 HE CONSIDERED THE VICTORY ALREADY HIS AND STEPPED FORWARD TO THE MEAT
zlp-20100110-kgx-a0324 IT WAS NOT RED EYE'S WAY TO FOREGO REVENGE SO EASILY
zlp-20100110-kgx-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
zlp-20100110-kgx-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT

zlp-20100110-kgx-a0329 AH INDEED
zlp-20100110-kgx-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED

zlp-20100110-lbe-b0509 HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTY AND PAID PROPERLY
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0510 HE KNEW WHAT TABOOS HE WAS VIOLATING
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0511 DO YOU VALUE YOUR HIDE
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0512 YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY HEARD ME SPITTING CHINOOK
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0513 HE PLODDED ON FOR HALF AN HOUR WHEN THE HALLUCINATION AROSE AGAIN
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0514 TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE GONE
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0515 BUT ALREADY HE HAD COMPOSED HIMSELF
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0516 ZILLA RELAXED HER SOUR MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO SIGH HER SATISFACTION
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
zlp-20100110-lbe-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
zlp-20100110-ujo-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
zlp-20100110-ujo-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
zlp-20100110-ujo-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR

zlp-20100110-ujo-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
zlp-20100110-ujo-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
zlp-20100110-ujo-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
zlp-20100110-vuh-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
zlp-20100110-vuh-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
zlp-20100110-vuh-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
zlp-20100110-vuh-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
